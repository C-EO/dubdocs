<Note>
  Deep links require a [Pro plan](https://dub.co/pricing) subscription or
  higher.
</Note>

Deferred deep linking allows you to track which link a user came from even when they don't have your app installed.

When a user clicks a link without the app installed, they're redirected to the app store. After installing and opening the app, you can retrieve the original link information and redirect them to the appropriate screen.

## Android Play Store

Android provides the [Install Referrer API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/installreferrer) which allows you to retrieve information about how a user came to install your app, including the referrer URL.

Here is how it works in a nutshell:

1. User taps a deep link on a device without your app installed
2. Dub redirects the user to the App Store or Play Store by using [device targeting](/help/article/device-targeting)
3. User installs your app from the app store
4. App reads the install referrer on first launch
5. App track the open using the [`/track/open`](/concepts/links/deep-links/quickstart#track-the-deep-link-open) endpoint
6. Redirect the user to the appropriate screen using the destination URL returned by the `/track/open` endpoint

To get started, we recommend using the [quickstart guide](/concepts/deep-links/quickstart) to set up your deep links on Dub.

## iOS App Store
