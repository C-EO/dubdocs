## Step 3: Handling deep link redirects in your app

When user opens app from a deep link:

1. check if the referrer URL is present. if it is not present, you might need to check the [Google Play Store Install Referrer API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/installreferrer) to see if the user came from a short link before downloading the app. See the [Deferred deep linking](/concepts/links/deep-links/deferred-deep-linking) guide for more information.

2. take the domain + key of the referrer URL and fire off /track/open request. this tracks the click + returns the main destination URL from step 2, which is the URL that the user will be redirected to.
