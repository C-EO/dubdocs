  higher.
</Note>

## Step 1: Configure your deep link domains on Dub

Before you can create deep links, you need to configure your deep link domains in your Dub workspace. This involves adding a custom domain that will be used for your deep links and configuring your deep link configuration files.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a custom domain">

First, you'll need to add a custom domain to your Dub workspace. Navigate to your [workspace's Domains settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains) and click **Add Domain**.

You can use a domain you already own, or leverage our [free .link domain offer](https://dub.co/help/article/free-dot-link-domain) to register a custom domain like `yourcompany.link` and usen it as your short link domain.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up your deep link configuration files">

Once you've set up your custom domain, you'll need to upload your deep link configuration files to Dub, which we'll host under the `/.well-known/` directory of your domain.

To do that, go to your [workspace domain settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains) page and click on the edit button for your custom domain:

</Frame>

In the domain modal, click on **Show advanced settings**, which will open up the Deep Link Configuration settings fields.

**iOS (apple-app-site-association)**

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "YOUR_APP_ID",
        "paths": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Android (assetlinks.json)**

For Android apps, upload your AssetLinks file to enable Android deep links:

```json
[
  {
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": []
    },
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"]
  }
]
```

</Step>

<Step title="Verify that your configuration files are set up correctly">

Once you've set up your deep link configuration files, you can go to their respective URLs to verify that they've been configured correctly:

**iOS:** `yourdomain.link/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` [(example)](https://getacme.link/.well-known/apple-app-site-association)

**Android:** `yourdomain.link/.well-known/assetlinks.json` [(example)](https://getacme.link/.well-known/assetlinks.json)

</Step>

<Step title="Whitelist your deep link domain in your app">
Last but not least, you'll need to whitelist your short link domain in your apps to allow them to redirect straight into a page within your app.

**For iOS apps**, you'll need to [allow websites to link to your apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content/).

**For Android apps**, you'll need to [verify your Android app links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks).

</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Create your deep links on Dub

Now that you've configured your deep link domains, you can create deep links that will redirect users to specific content within your app.

<Steps>

<Step title="Enter your destination URL">

Go to your [Dub dashboard](https://app.dub.co) and click **Create Link** in the top navigation bar.

Enter your destination URL in the "Destination URL" field. You can enter the URL with or without the `https://` protocol – behind the scenes, Dub will automatically make sure it's formatted correctly.

This is the URL that opens a specific screen or piece of content within your app. For example `https://yourapp.com/product/Apple-MacBook` opens the product detail screen for `Apple-MacBook`.

  />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Set a short link slug">

Under the Short Link field, you can either:

1. Enter your own short link slug
2. Generate a random short link slug
3. Generate a short link slug with AI.

For example, you can set a short link slug like `apple-macbook` to open the product detail screen for `Apple-MacBook`.

<Note>
  This step is optional. If you don't enter a short link slug, Dub will generate
  one for you.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Add device targeting">

[Device Targeting](https://dub.co/help/article/device-targeting) enables you to redirect users to the App Store or Google Play Store if your app isn’t installed.

For example, you can set custom destination URLs for different devices using the link builder — use the **iOS Targeting** input for iOS devices, and the **Android Targeting** input for Android devices.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
  Dub's link builder offers many additional features like UTM builder, password
  protection, expiration dates, geo targeting, and more. [Learn more about

## Step 3: Handling deep link redirects in your app

When user opens app from a deep link:

1. check if the referrer URL is present. if it is not present, you might need to check the [Google Play Store Install Referrer API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/installreferrer) to see if the user came from a short link before downloading the app. See the [Deferred deep linking](/concepts/links/deep-links/deferred-deep-linking) guide for more information.

2. take the domain + key of the referrer URL and fire off /track/open request. this tracks the click + returns the main destination URL from step 2, which is the URL that the user will be redirected to.
