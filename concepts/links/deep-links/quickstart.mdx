## Step 1: Configure your deep link domains on Dub

Before you can create deep links, you need to configure your deep link domains in your Dub workspace. This involves adding a custom domain that will be used for your deep links and configuring your deep link configuration files.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a custom domain">

First, you'll need to add a custom domain to your Dub workspace. Navigate to your [workspace's Domains settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains) and click **Add Domain**.

You can use a domain you already own, or leverage our [free .link domain offer](https://dub.co/help/article/free-dot-link-domain) to register a custom domain like `yourcompany.link` and usen it as your short link domain.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up your deep link configuration files">

Once you've set up your custom domain, you'll need to upload your deep link configuration files to Dub, which we'll host under the `/.well-known/` directory of your domain.

To do that, go to your [workspace domain settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains) page and click on the edit button for your custom domain:

</Frame>

In the domain modal, click on **Show advanced settings**, which will open up the Deep Link Configuration settings fields.

**iOS (apple-app-site-association)**

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "YOUR_APP_ID",
        "paths": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Android (assetlinks.json)**

For Android apps, upload your AssetLinks file to enable Android deep links:

```json
[
  {
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": []
    },
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"]
  }
]
```

</Step>

<Step title="Verify that your configuration files are set up correctly">

Once you've set up your deep link configuration files, you can go to their respective URLs to verify that they've been configured correctly:

**iOS:** `yourdomain.link/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` [(example)](https://getacme.link/.well-known/apple-app-site-association)

**Android:** `yourdomain.link/.well-known/assetlinks.json` [(example)](https://getacme.link/.well-known/assetlinks.json)

</Step>

<Step title="Whitelist your deep link domain in your app">
Last but not least, you'll need to whitelist your short link domain in your apps to allow them to redirect straight into a page within your app.

**For iOS apps**, you'll need to [allow websites to link to your apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content/).

**For Android apps**, you'll need to [verify your Android app links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks).

## Step 3: Handling deep link redirects in your app

When user opens app from a deep link:

1. check if the referrer URL is present. if it is not present, you might need to check the [Google Play Store Install Referrer API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/installreferrer) to see if the user came from a short link before downloading the app. See the [Deferred deep linking](/concepts/links/deep-links/deferred-deep-linking) guide for more information.

2. take the domain + key of the referrer URL and fire off /track/open request. this tracks the click + returns the main destination URL from step 2, which is the URL that the user will be redirected to.
