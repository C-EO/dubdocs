[Dub Partners](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-partners) lets you build powerful, scalable referral and affiliate programs with 1-click global payouts and white-labeling functionality.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Dub Partners:

1. [Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-1-install-the-dub-analytics-client-side-sdk)
2. [Install the Dub server-side SDK + track conversion events](#step-2-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk--track-conversion-events)
3.

## Step 1: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

First, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

On top of that, it also:

- lets you [track clicks on the client-side](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`)
- [automatically fetch the partner and discount data](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking#automatically-fetching-partner-and-discount-data) for a given link – which is helpful for displaying [dual-sided incentives](/partners/dual-sided-incentives)

Once the script is installed, make sure to verify that [client-side click tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking) is working as expected by checking if the following is true:

<VerifyTrackClick />
