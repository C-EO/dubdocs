## Step 1: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

First, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This will handle the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.
