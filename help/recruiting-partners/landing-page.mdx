## What is the program landing page?

The program landing page gives your applicants information about your program and the rewards offered. This also includes brand or marketing files, FAQ sections, and any other content you want to add that will help an applicant understand your program, what your product is, and why they should apply.

On Dub, you can create a custom landing page for each [partner group](/help/getting-started/partner-groups) in your program. This is helpful for showcasing different information about your program tailored to different partner types – e.g. influencers vs affiliates vs resellers.

By default, when you create a new partner group, it reuses the landing page details from your default partner group, but you can always edit them afterwards.

## Where to find the landing page builder?

From your Groups page, open the group you want to customize the landing page for. From the tab navigation, click Branding, then in the content panel, choose Landing page to open the editor.

## Editing and adding content

As you hover over the landing page content in the builder, you'll notice that actions will show, allowing you to add, edit, delete, and reorder content blocks within the page.

Content above the reward section can only be edited. This is to maintain content consistency. Content below the "Apply today" button can be added, edited, removed, and reordered.

## Content types

Clicking on "Insert block" allows you to select the content type you want to add.

### Text

Best used for text and paragraph content. This section also uses markdown formatting when editing.

### Image

For adding product screenshots and other complementary visuals to the program.

### Files

For adding product screenshots and other complementary visuals to the program.

### Accordion

Best used for FAQ sections and other collapsible related content. This section also uses markdown formatting when editing.

### Earnings calculator

Give your partners a sense of how much they can earn, based on your default rewards.

## Generating your landing page with AI

You can also use our AI landing page generator to quickly scaffold a landing page for your affiliate program.

Our AI will scrape your website, retrieve all relevant information, and craft a compelling landing page with your company's details, pricing information, features, and more.

To get started, simply click the "Generate" button and enter your website URL (it should already be prefilled from your program settings).

AI can make mistakes – make sure to review all generated content for accuracy and style before publishing your changes.

## Publishing your changes

Once you're finished making your content changes, click the Publish button in the top right corner to make sure the changes go live.
