  This feature is only available for [Business plans and above](https://dub.co/pricing).
</Note>

With [Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners), you can [send payouts](/help/sending-payouts/partner-payouts) to your affiliates using your credit card on file. However, for larger payouts, it might be more cost-efficient to set up your bank account for direct debit instead.

Depending on your bank's country, we support 3 different types of direct debit methods:

- **Europe:** Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)
- **Canada:** Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS)
- **US:** Automated Clearing House (ACH)

Due to the fraud/dispute risks involved with SEPA direct debit, it is currently only available on [Enterprise](https://dub.co/enterprise) plans.

## Connecting your bank account to Dub

Here's how you can connect your bank account to Dub for partner payouts:

### Step 1: Add a new direct debit method

On your [workspace's billing tab](https://app.dub.co/settings/billing), scroll down to Payment methods section.

Click on the Connect button to add a new direct debit method. This will open up a modal with the following direct debit methods:

- **Europe:** Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)
- **Canada:** Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS)
- **US:** Automated Clearing House (ACH)

Select the correct method based on your bank's location, and you'll be redirected to the Stripe connection flow.

### Step 2: Connect your bank account

Next, search for your bank that you want to connect to Dub. Search for your bank, and follow the steps to connect your account.

If you selected SEPA direct debit in the previous step, you will need to manually enter your IBAN number and account details to set it up instead.

### Step 3: Manually verify bank account (optional)

Alternatively, you can also manually verify your bank account via the [micro-deposits verification method](https://stripe.com/ie/resources/more/what-is-micro-deposit-verification-here-is-how-it-works).

To do that, select the Enter bank details manually option. Then, enter your bank details (routing number, account number).

You'll receive a micro deposit in your account within 1-2 business days that will include a six-character descriptor code starting with `SM`:

```
SMXXXX
```

Once you receive the micro-deposit, [reach out to support](https://dub.co/contact/support) with the code and we'll help you verify your bank account.

## My bank account is currently unavailable

Depending on which bank you select, Stripe might show an error that the bank is currently unavailable. If that happens, follow Step 3 above to manually verify your bank account.
