This page explains how Dub Partners is structured and how data flows from a partner link to a commission. Use it to plan your implementation and understand how to configure your program.

## The big picture

```
Program (your partner program)
  └── Partner Groups (tiers with different reward rules)
        └── Partners (people in each group)
              └── Links (their tracking links)
                    └── Clicks → Leads/Sales → Commissions → Payouts
```

## Core building blocks

### Program

Your **program** is the top-level container. It has:

- **Name and branding** – Logo, description, terms URL
- **Primary reward event** – What you pay on by default: sale, lead, or click
- **Payout settings** – Minimum payout amount, payout mode (internal via Dub, external, or hybrid)
- **Landing page** – Where new partners can learn about and apply to your program

One workspace = one program. Create it via the [program onboarding flow](https://app.dub.co/program/new).

### Partner groups

**Partner groups** let you segment partners and give each segment different rules:

- **Reward rules** – Click reward, lead reward, sale reward (e.g., 10% of sale, $5 per lead)
- **Link structure** – Short links (`dub.co/abc`), query params (`yoursite.com?via=partner`), or path-based
- **Application form** – Custom questions for applicants
- **Landing page** – Group-specific signup/apply page

Example: "Affiliates" get 10% of sale; "VIP Partners" get 15% and a custom landing page.

### Partners

A **partner** is a person or company enrolled in your program. They have:

- **Profile** – Name, email, company, payout details (PayPal or Stripe Connect)
- **Enrollment** – Which program and group they belong to
- **Links** – Their unique tracking links
- **Stats** – Clicks, leads, sales, commissions

Partners can be invited, apply and get approved, or be auto-enrolled via an [embedded referral dashboard](/partners/embedded-referrals).

### Links

**Links** are how attribution works. Each partner gets links that include a tracking identifier. When someone clicks:

1. Dub records the click and stores a `dub_id` cookie (or equivalent) on the visitor's device
2. When the visitor converts (signs up, purchases), your app sends that `dub_id` to Dub
3. Dub attributes the conversion to the partner and creates a commission

Links can be:

- **Short links** – `dub.co/xyz` (Dub-hosted)
- **Query parameter** – `yoursite.com?via=partner-slug`
- **Path-based** – `yoursite.com/ref/partner-slug`

Configure this per partner group.

### Rewards and commissions

**Rewards** define how partners earn. You can set:

- **Click reward** – Fixed amount per click (e.g., $0.10)
- **Lead reward** – Fixed amount per lead (e.g., $5)
- **Sale reward** – Percentage or fixed amount per sale (e.g., 10% of revenue)

**Commissions** are the calculated amounts. Dub creates a commission when a conversion matches your reward rules. Commissions can be pending, approved, or paid out.

## Conversion flow (technical)

For developers: here's how attribution works end-to-end.

1. **Click** – Visitor clicks a partner link. The `@dub/analytics` script (or equivalent) captures the click and sets a `dub_id` cookie.
2. **Lead** – Visitor signs up. Your backend reads `dub_id` and calls `POST /track/lead` (or SDK equivalent). Dub attributes the lead to the partner.
3. **Sale** – Visitor purchases. Your backend (or Stripe webhook) sends `POST /track/sale` with the customer ID. Dub attributes the sale and creates a commission.
