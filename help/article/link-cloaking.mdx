<Tip>
  This feature is only available for [Pro plans and
  above](/help/article/pro-plan).
</Tip>

With Dub.co, you can mask your destination URL with your short link.

To enable link cloaking, click on the more options button `...` in the link builder and select the **Add Link Cloaking** option.

This is useful when you want to show your brand or custom domain instead of the actual destination URL.

When this is enabled, your short link will be shown in your users' browser address bar when they visit your link instead of the destination URL.

## Link cloaking caveats

A few caveats for the link cloaking feature:

1. For link cloaking to work, make sure you use `https` for your destination URL. If your destination URL is `http`, the browser will show a "Not Secure" warning, and link cloaking will not work.
2. Link cloaking might not work for certain websites that have security measures in place to prevent this:

- `X-Frame-Options` header set to `DENY`
- `content-security-policy` header set to `frame-ancestors 'none'`

## Link cloaking with security headers

If you have control over the destination URL that you are cloaking, you can leverage security headers to enable link cloaking on Dub while also disabling iframe embedding everywhere else.

### Adding security headers to your destination URL

To do this, you need to whitelist your [Dub short domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) as an allowed origin on your site by adding the following response headers to your site:

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' [shortdomain.com]
```

For example, if your Dub short domain is `dub.link`, you would need to add the following headers to your destination URL:

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' dub.link
```

### Whitelisting multiple domains

You can also whitelist multiple domains by separating them with a space:

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' dub.link otherdomain.com
```

This will ensure that your site cannot be embedded in third-party sites but can still be cloaked by your Dub short domain.
