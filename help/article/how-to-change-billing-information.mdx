## Change your billing information on Stripe

Since we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to process payments, you can change your billing information on Stripe by following the steps below:

1. From your workspace dashboard (e.g. `app.dub.co/your-workspace`), click on the **Settings** tab.
2. On the left sidebar, click on **Billing**.
3. Click on the **Open billing portal** button to access your Stripe dashboard.

4. Scroll down to the **Payment Method** section.
5. Here, you can add a new payment method or update your existing payment method.
