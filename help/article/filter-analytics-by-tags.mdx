On Dub, you can filter analytics by [tags](/help/article/how-to-use-tags). This allows you to create powerful campaign-specific reports for your links.

For example, you're running an Instagram influencer campaign with multiple links and you want to see how they're performing.

You can group the links with a **Instagram Influencers** tag and then filter the analytics by that tag to get a comprehensive report of how they're performing.

Before you can filter analytics by tags, you need to [create a tag](/help/article/how-to-use-tags#how-to-create-a-tag) and [assign it to the links you want to filter by](/help/article/how-to-use-tags#can-i-assign-multiple-tags-to-a-link).

<CheckList>
  <CheckListItem
    title="Create a tag"
    href="/help/article/how-to-use-tags#how-to-create-a-tag"
  >
    If you haven't already, create a tag to filter your analytics by.
  </CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem
    title="Assign the tag to the relevant links"
    href="/help/article/how-to-use-tags#can-i-assign-multiple-tags-to-a-link"
  >
    Add the tag to all the links you want to filter by.
  </CheckListItem>
</CheckList>

Then, as your links start accruing clicks, you will be able to filter your analytics by tags.
