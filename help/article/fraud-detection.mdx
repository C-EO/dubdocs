## Using Fraud Detection
Dub's Fraud Detection helps you catch and take action on any fraudulent activity in your program. We give you the details for each event so you can make the best decision for your program and customers.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/fraud-table.png" alt="Fraud table view" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

The table view contains the the following columns:
- **Event:** The specific unique fraud event associated with a partner.
- **Partner:** The partner associated with the fraud event.
- **Last Detected:** The date and time of the most recent occurrence of this fraud event.

Each row is a single event type for a given partner and can contain multiple event occurrences within it. There may be times when you see multiple rows for the same partner, and in this scenario, the partner has been flagged for multiple events that require your review.

## Fraud event types
Here are the event types you might see flagged and detected in your program.

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-program ban | This partner has been banned from one or more other Dub programs, indicating a potential high-risk history. To protect security and privacy, specific details such as links, evidence, or notes are not shared across programs. |
| Duplicate payout method | This partner is using a payout method that is already linked to another partner account, which may indicate account duplication or fraudulent behavior. |
| Matching customer email | Partner's email matches a customer's email and could be a self referral. |
| Suspicious customer email domain | Customer's email uses a disposable or temporary domain, which could be a fraud attempt. |
| Banned referral source (customizable) | A conversion, event, or click was made on a banned referral domain. |
| Paid traffic (customizable) | A conversion, event, or click was made from paid advertising traffic. |
| Fraud report | This partner was reported for suspected fraud during their application to another program and was rejected. |

## Reviewing fraud events
<Warning>
  We recommended that you review partners flagged for fraud and the information provided before making a final decision.
</Warning>

Click on any table row to open the review panel. When reviewing events, there are three panels of information for each item.

<Steps>  
<Step title="Partner information">  
This is the partner associated with the event. From this section, you can click to message them or to view their profile.

<Step title="Event details">

</Step>

<Step title="Commissions on hold">  
If this partner has any pending commissions, you'll see the list of all commissions on hold. These are any commissions that have occurred since the flagged event.

## Resolving fraud events
When reviewing events, we recommend taking your time and ensuring a proper investigation is done. This could involve:
1. Viewing multiple partner/customer profiles to verify if they are duplicates/self-referrals.
2. Reviewing your internal sales information for any fraud signals (e.g. via [Stripe Radar](https://stripe.com/radar)).
3. Reaching out to the partner in question via our [built-in messaging center](/help/article/messaging-partners) to get clarification on their referral activity.

Then, once you've confirmed the veracity of the reports, you can move on to the next step.

### Resolve fraud event
If a fraud event is deemed to be benign, you can select the **Resolve event** option to mark the event as safe and keep the partner in your program. 

When confirming the decision, you're able to provide optional additional notes about the steps taken to confirm the details, or any other information.

### Ban partner
If the fraud event turns out to be malicious, you can select the **Ban partner** option to mark the event as fraudulent and ban the partner from your program. 

If the partner has other fraud events for review, those events will automatically be resolved as well when the partner is banned.

A reason must also be selected from the following options:

| Reason | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Terms of Service Violation | Partner violated your program rules or Dub’s terms of service. |
| Inappropriate or Offensive Content | Partner associated your brand or program link with harmful, explicit, or inappropriate content. |
| Artificial Traffic Generation | Partner used bots, fake clicks, or other methods to inflate traffic. |
| Fraudulent Activity | Partner generated fake clicks, leads, or other tracked actions to earn rewards. |
| Spam or Misleading Content | Partner used deceptive messaging, false claims, impersonation, or unsolicited promotion. |
| Brand Abuse or Trademark Violations | Partner misused your brand name, trademarks, or created confusion. |


## Resolved fraud events
To view your resolved events, click the `⋮` dropdown in the top right and select **Resolved events**.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/fraud-resolved-events.png" alt="Resolved events" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

Click on any of the resolved items to see the event details, who resolved the event, and any additional notes.

## Fraud settings
We give you the option to customize some of your fraud detection settings. To edit these, click the **Fraud settings** button in the top right.



### Paid traffic
If your program doesn't allow traffic from advertisers, ensure this setting is enabled. 

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/fraud-settings-drawer.png" alt="Fraud settings" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

When enabled, it will flag all partner traffic that has been generated from several sources, including:
- Google
- Facebook
- X
- Bing
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- TikTok

### Referral source
If you want to flag traffic from a specific URL, enable this setting and then add the URLs you wish to monitor. 

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/fraud-settings-referral.png" alt="Referral settings" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

When adding URLs, you can also use `*` wildcards to match any part of a domain. These a great when monitoring for a specific page and not all traffic from the specific URL.

### Disabling fraud settings
When you disable any of the current active settings, you're also given the option to mark and pending events that match that criteria as "Resolved".

To do this, check the box labelled "Mark all pending events for this rule as `Resolved`" in the confirmation modal.
