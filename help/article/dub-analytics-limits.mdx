- Breakdown by location (country, city, continent)
- Breakdown by device (type, browser, operating system)
- Top links, UTM parameters, and referrer data
- [AI filtering](/help/article/dub-analytics#bonus-ask-ai-feature) feature
- Filtering by [tags](/help/article/filter-analytics-by-tags), [QR code vs link clicks](/help/article/filter-analytics-by-trigger) and more
- Real-time [analytics-sharing](/help/article/share-analytics)

## What happens when I exceed the tracked clicks limit on my plan?

If you exceed your monthly tracked clicks limits, your existing links will still work and we will continue to track clicks on them. However, you will need to [upgrade your plan](https://app.dub.co/upgrade) to view their analytics.

You will receive two email notifications when you exceed your tracked clicks limit – once when you first exceed the limit, and once more in 3 days if you still have not upgraded your plan.

We currently do not bill for overages. However, to prevent abuse, if you exceed your tracked clicks limit by a certain threshold, your clicks will not be reset at the start of your billing period.

Here are the thresholds for each plan:

| Plan            | Threshold                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Free            | 4x your plan's monthly limit (4,000 clicks) |
| All other plans | 2x your plan's monthly limit                |

When that happens, you can [upgrade your plan](https://app.dub.co/upgrade) to reset your tracked clicks limit.
