</Tip>

On Dub, you can easily invite your teammates to join your Dub workspace. This is useful if you want to collaborate with your team on your short links.

To start inviting your teammates, you first need to [create a workspace](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace#how-to-create-a-workspace) on Dub.

Once you have created a workspace, you have two different ways to invite your teammates:

- Via [email](#sending-an-invite)
- Via [invite links](#using-invite-links)

## Sending an invite

To invite a teammate via email, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your workspace's Members Settings page. You can do that by clicking on the **Settings** link in the menu bar at the top of your workspace dashboard, and click on the **People** tab on the left sidebar.
2. Click on the **Invite** button to open the Invite Teammate modal.
3. Enter your teammate's email address and [assign them a role](/help/article/workspace-roles).
4. You can also click on the **Add email** button to invite multiple teammates at once.
5. Then, click on the **Send invite** button to send the invitations to your teammates.

## Using invite links

You can also invite your teammates to join your workspace by sharing an invite link with them. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your workspace's Members Settings page.
2. Click on the **Link** button to open the Invite Link Modal.

You can then share the invite link with your teammates via email, chat, or any other communication tool.

1. Navigate to your workspace's Members Settings page.
2. Click on the **Invitations** tab.
3. Click on the `⋮` button next to the invitation you want to revoke.
4. Click on the **Remove** button to open the Remove Invitation modal.

## Removing a teammate

If a teammate no longer needs access to your workspace, you can remove them from your workspace.

1. Navigate to your workspace's Members Settings page.
2. Click on the `⋮` button next to the teammate you want to remove.
3. Click on the **Remove** button to open the Remove Teammate modal.
4. Click on the **Confirm remove** button to confirm.

In some cases, a user might also be associated with [created API
keys](/docs/api-reference/tokens), so you'll see a slightly different "remove
modal", showing the keys this user is associated with. If you delete a user,
their corresponding API keys will be deleted as well.
