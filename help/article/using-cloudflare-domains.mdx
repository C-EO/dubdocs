If you're using a domain on Cloudflare for your Dub workspace, you might need to configure a few extra steps to make sure that your domain works properly.

## Using Cloudflare's DNS only (recommended)

We recommend using Cloudflare's DNS only mode for your custom domain. This makes sure that requests/clicks to your short links will always reach Dub directly instead of being served through Cloudflare – which can lead to [inaccurate analytics data](/help/article/incorrect-analytics-geolocation-data).

Configuring Cloudflare as DNS only is also better for redirect speeds, since you avoid having your users' requests get proxied through Cloudflare, which adds additional latency.

To set this up, all you need to do is [set your domain's DNS records](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) to point to Dub's servers and make sure that you're using the **DNS only** option on Cloudflare.

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain.
2. Click on the **DNS** tab on the sidebar menu.
3. Under **Records**, click on the **Edit** button.
4. Change the **Proxy status** to **DNS only**.
5. Click on the **Save** button.

This will make sure that the traffic to your domain is _not proxied through Cloudflare_ and is sent directly to Dub.

## Using Cloudflare's Proxy

If you really want to use Cloudflare's proxy for your custom domain, you'll need to make sure that your SSL/TLS encryption mode is set to "Full" on Cloudflare.

You can do that by following these steps:

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain.
2. Click on the **SSL/TLS** tab on the sidebar menu.
3. Under **Overview**, click on the **Configure** button.
4. Select the **Custom SSL/TLS** option and then select the **Full** option.
5. Click on **Save** to apply the changes.

<Warning>
  Using Cloudflare's Proxy can potentially **cause [inaccuracies in analytics
  data](/help/article/incorrect-analytics-geolocation-data)**. This is because using a proxy will send all traffic through the proxy
  first, then to Dub. This will result in incorrect geolocation data being
  presented and the public IP address of your proxy being sent.

To avoid this, we recommend using [Cloudflare's DNS only mode](#using-cloudflares-dns-only-without-proxy) instead of using
their proxy.

</Warning>
