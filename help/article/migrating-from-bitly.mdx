## How to migrate from Bitly to Dub.co

If you're looking to migrate from Bitly to Dub.co, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate your links in just 2-3 clicks.

<Steps>

<Step title="Sign in with Bitly">

If you haven't already, [create a workspace on Dub.co](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace#how-to-create-a-workspace).

<Info>
  **Protip**: Once you create your workspace, we generally recommend you **_not
  to [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain)_** until
  you've migrated all your links. This will prevent any potential downtime for
  your links.
</Info>

Then, from your workspace dashboard, click on the `⋮` button next to the **Create Link** button and select **Import from Bitly**.

Behind the scenes, we'll fetch all your Bitly groups and their respective custom domains and number of tags. You'll be presented with a list of groups that we've found.

<Info>
  If you accidentally signed in to the wrong Bitly account, you can click on the
  **Sign in with a different account?** link to sign in with a different Bitly
  account.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Select the domains you want to migrate">

Select the domains you want to migrate and choose if you'd like to import their respective tags as well. You can learn more about [how tags work on Dub.co](/help/article/how-to-use-tags).

Once you're done, click **Confirm import**. In just a few seconds, all your links will be migrated to Dub.co.

Once all your links have been imported, we will send you an email to let you know that the migration is complete.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain">

Once you receive the email, you can [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) by setting the right DNS records. This will ensure that your links are pointing to Dub.co and not Bitly. Once you've done this, you can start using your links!
