With Dub Partners, you can create non-monetary rewards for your partners, such as:

- Free usage credits for every new user they refer
- Free month of service for every new user they refer – up to 12 months

This is specifially useful for referral programs – especially when you're using the [embedded referral dashboard](/docs/partners/embedded-referrals) – since it gives you an easy way to incentivize your existing userbase to refer new users to your product.

<Note>

While non-monetary rewards are easy to set up, we've seen that cash incentives are generally more impactful/sustainable in the long run – especially when you're working with influencers and larger affiliates.

To get the best of both worlds, you can potentially start your users on a [non-monetary referral partner group](#step-1-set-up-a-separate-partner-group-for-non-monetary-rewards) and [graduate them to a monetary reward group](#graduating-partners-from-non-monetary-rewards-to-monetary-rewards) once they've referred a certain number of users.

</Note>

## Step 1: Set up a separate partner group for non-monetary rewards

First, you would want to create a separate [partner group](/help/article/partner-groups) for your user referral program.

In this group, you can set up a [non-monetary reward](/help/article/partner-rewards) that can be either a lead or a sale-based reward:

- Lead reward: Rewarding partners for new users signups (or qualified leads if you're using [deferred lead tracking](/docs/conversions/leads/deferred))
- Sale reward: Rewarding partners for paid customer referrals

When creating the reward, you could want to set the reward amount to $0 and add a [custom description](/help/article/partner-rewards#custom-reward-descriptions) to explain the reward to your partners:

    alt="Lead reward description tooltip"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can also set up a [custom reward
  tooltip](/help/article/partner-rewards#custom-reward-descriptions) which
  supports markdown formatting, so you'd be able to add links to your terms and
  conditions or other relevant information.
</Tip>

Additionally, you can also set up [dual-sided incentives](/help/article/dual-sided-incentives) for your users to offer discounts to their users who sign up via their referral link (e.g. "25% off for the first 3 months").

Once this is set up, your partners will be able to see the reward and discount in the [embedded referral dashboard](/docs/partners/embedded-referrals):

## Step 2: Listen to Dub webhooks and provision rewards to your partners

To provision the non-monetary rewards (credits, free months, etc.) to your partners, you would need to listen to Dub's [webhook events](/docs/webhooks/event-types) to detect when a new signup / sale is tracked.

Depending on the reward you're offering, you would need to listen to:

- [`lead.created`](/docs/webhooks/events/lead-created) - if you're offering a lead reward
- [`sale.created`](/docs/webhooks/events/sale-created) - if you're offering a sale reward

Then, within the webhook handler, you can update the partner's Stripe subscription to provision the free credits / months accordingly:

```ts title="app/api/webhooks/dub/lead-created/route.ts"
import Stripe from "stripe";
// Install via npm i dub / yarn add dub / pnpm add dub
import { LeadCreatedEvent } from "dub/models/components";

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);

export async function leadCreated(data: LeadCreatedEvent["data"]) {
  const { partner } = data;
  if (!partner?.tenantId) return;

  // Limit the number of free credits / months that a partner can receive (max 10 referrals)
  if (partner.totalLeads >= 10) return;

  // Get customer based on partner's tenant ID (getCustomerByTenantId is your own function)
  const customer = await getCustomerByTenantId(partner.tenantId);

  if (!customer?.stripeCustomerId) return;

  // Get the customer's active subscription (e.g. for metered usage / free months)
  // Get the customer's active subscription (e.g. for metered usage / free months)
  const subscriptions = await stripe.subscriptions.list({
    customer: customer.stripeCustomerId,
    status: "active",
    limit: 1,
  });

  const [subscription] = subscriptions.data;

  if (!subscription?.items.data[0]) return;

  // Option A: Add free credits via metered usage
  await stripe.subscriptionItems.createUsageRecord(
    subscription.items.data[0].id,
    { quantity: 500, timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) },
  );

  // Option B: Or extend the subscription (e.g. add 1 free month via promotion/coupon)
  // await stripe.subscriptions.update(subscription.id, {
  //   promotion_code: "promo_free_month_per_referral",
  // });
}
```

## Step 3: Graduating partners from non-monetary rewards to monetary rewards

Once a partner has referred a certain number of users, you can move them to a separate [partner group](/help/article/partner-groups) with monetary rewards (e.g. 30% commission per sale for 12 months).

There are a two ways to do this:

1. Manually move the partner to the new group from the [partner profile page](/help/article/managing-program-partners#partner-details) or via the [partner table](/help/article/partner-groups#adding-multiple-partners-to-a-group).
2. Automatically move the partner to the new group via [group move rules](/help/article/partner-groups#group-move-rules) based on their performance metrics (e.g. total leads, total sales, total commissions, etc.).
