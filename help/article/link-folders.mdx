Folders are a great way to organize and manage access to your links on Dub.

With folders, you can:

1. **Organize links by marketing channels**. E.g. if you're using Dub for both your [affiliate program](https://dub.co/partners) and for SMS marketing, you can create folders for both so those links doesn't clutter your main links dashboard.
2. **Manage access to links across your team**. E.g. if you have marketing teams from different departments within your Dub workspace, you can create folders for each team with [role-based access controls](/help/article/folders-rbac) to ensure members can only see the links that they should have access to.

In this guide, we'll walk through how to use folders to organize and manage access to your links on Dub.

## Creating a folder

There are a few ways you can create a new folder:

<Steps>
<Step title="In your links dashboard">
You can quickly create a new folder within your links dashboard:

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="New folder links dashboard"
  />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="In the link builder">
You can also create a new folder directly inside the [link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder):

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/new-folder-link-builder.png"
    alt="New folder link builder"
  />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="In the folder library">
Last but not least, you can also create a folder inside your [folder library](http://app.dub.co/settings/library/folders):

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/new-folder-folder-library.png"
    alt="New folder link builder"
  />
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

Creating a folder is fairly simple. First, give it a name:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-new-folder.png"
    alt="Create new folder"
  />
</Frame>

Then, you can also choose the [workspace-level permission](/help/article/folders-rbac) for the folder:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-new-folder-access.png"
    alt="Create new folder access"
  />
</Frame>

## Adding links to a folder

To add links to a folder, simply select the folder you want to move the link to within the [link edit page](https://dub.co/changelog/link-pages) and click "Save changes":

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/move-link-folder.png"
    alt="Move link to folder"
  />
</Frame>

Alternatively, you can also move a link to a folder directly within the links dashboard:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/move-link-folder-shortcut.png"
    alt="Move link to folder shortcut"
  />
</Frame>

Last but not least, you can use [bulk link actions](/help/article/bulk-link-actions) to move multiple links to a folder at once:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/move-link-folder-bulk.png"
    alt="Move link to folder bulk"
  />
</Frame>
## Setting a default folder

Once you've created a few folders, you can choose one to show up by default when you open your links dashboard.

To do that, open the `⋮` dropdown next to the folder in your links dashboard and select the "Set as Default" option:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/set-default-folder.png"
    alt="Set default folder"
  />
</Frame>

You can also do this inside your [folder library](http://app.dub.co/settings/library/folders):

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/set-default-folder-library.png"
    alt="Set default folder library"
  />
</Frame>

## How many folders can I create?

The number of folders you can create depends on your plan:

- **Pro plan**: Up to 3 folders
- **Business plan**: Up to 20 folders
- **Advanced plan**: Up to 50 folders
- **Enterprise plan**: Unlimited folders

## Managing folders programmatically

You can also manage folders programmatically using the [Dub API](/docs/api-reference/introduction).

Here are a few things you can do with the API:

- [Update a folder](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-folder)
- [Delete a folder](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/delete-a-folder)
- [Retrieve a list of folders](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-folders)
