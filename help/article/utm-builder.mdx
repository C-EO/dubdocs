UTM (short for _Urchin Tracking Module_) parameters are great for marketing links because they provide detailed tracking and analytics. Here’s why:

- **Source Identification**: They specify the source of traffic (e.g., Facebook, Google), helping to identify which platforms are driving traffic.
- **Campaign Tracking**: They track specific marketing campaigns, allowing marketers to evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign.
- **Medium Differentiation**: They distinguish between different types of marketing mediums (e.g., email, social media, PPC).
- **Content Performance**: They track different content pieces within a campaign, providing insights on what content resonates best with the audience.
- **ROI Measurement**: They help in calculating the return on investment (ROI) for different marketing efforts.

## Dub's UTM Builder

To make it easier to add UTM parameters to your links, Dub provides a UTM builder that allows you to easily populate UTM parameters for your links. [Here's a live demo](https://dub.co/tools/utm-builder) that you can play around with.

Here are the UTM parameters that Dub supports:

| Parameter        | Code           | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UTM Source**   | `utm_source`   | The source of your traffic (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). |
| **UTM Medium**   | `utm_medium`   | The medium of your traffic (e.g. social, email, etc.).     |
| **UTM Campaign** | `utm_campaign` | The name of your campaign (e.g. summer2023)                |
| **UTM Term**     | `utm_term`     | The term of your campaign (e.g. running+shoes)             |
| **UTM Content**  | `utm_content`  | The content of your campaign (e.g. logo+link)              |
| **Referral**     | `ref`          | The website that is sending traffic to your link.          |

As you can see, we also support an increasingly common parameter `ref` – as popularized by sites like [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) and [OSS Gallery](https://oss.gallery/).
