You want to run a partner or affiliate program—reward people who refer customers to you. This guide walks you through the program creation flow in the Dub dashboard. No technical background needed for most of it; you'll need a developer for one step (tracking) after your program is created.

## Step 1: Getting started

**Goal:** Set your company info and where partner links will send people.

    alt="Getting started step in Create partner program"
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
  />
</Frame>

1. **Company name** – The name of your company (e.g., "Acme").
2. **Logo** – Upload a square logo. It appears on your program landing page and in partner materials.
3. **Referral link** – Set the domain and destination for partner links:
   - **Program domain** – Choose one:
     - **Claim a free .link domain** – No setup. Free for one year with your paid account.
     - **Connect a domain you own** – DNS setup required. Use a domain dedicated to your program (e.g., `refer.yourcompany.com`).
   - **Website URL** – Where visitors go when they click a partner's referral link (e.g., `https://yourproduct.com`).

Click **Continue** to go to the next step.

## Step 2: Configure rewards

**Goal:** Define how partners earn—e.g., 15% of each sale for 12 months.

    alt="Configure rewards step in Create partner program"
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
  />
</Frame>

1. **Reward type** – What partners get paid for:
   - **Sale** – When revenue is generated (most common for SaaS).
   - **Lead** – For sign-ups and demos.

2. **Commission structure** – How the reward applies:
   - **Recurring** – Ongoing revenue share (e.g., 15% of each payment for 12 months). Most common for subscriptions.
   - **One-off** – Fixed payout per conversion (e.g., $20 per sale).

3. **Duration** – For recurring: how long partners earn (e.g., 12 months).

4. **Reward amount** – How much partners earn:
   - **Percentage** – Share of revenue (e.g., 15% per sale).
   - **Flat** – Fixed amount per conversion (e.g., $20 per lead).

Enter your percentage or flat amount and click **Continue**.

<Tip>
  You can add more reward rules and partner groups later in your program
  settings.

## Step 3: Invite partners

**Goal:** Optionally invite your first partners now. You can skip and add them later.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/help/program-new-invite-partners.png"
    alt="Invite partners step in Create partner program"
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
  />
</Frame>

1. Enter partner **email addresses**.
2. Click **+ Add partner** to add each one.
3. Click **Continue** to proceed (you can also skip and invite later from the Partners tab).

---

## Step 4: Help and Support

**Goal:** Add support info that partners see on their dashboard. Support email is required before your first partner joins.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/help/program-new-help-support.png"
    alt="Help and Support step in Create partner program"
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
  />
</Frame>

1. **Support email** _(required)_ – Where partners can reach you for questions.
2. **Help center URL** – Link to your help docs or FAQ (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com/help`).
3. **Terms of Service URL** – Link to your affiliate/partner terms (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com/legal/affiliates`).

These appear on the partner dashboard. You can add or update them later in program settings.

Click **Continue**.

## Step 5: Overview

**Goal:** Review your choices and create the program.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/help/program-new-overview.png"
    alt="Overview step in Create partner program"
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
  />
</Frame>

You'll see a summary of:

- **Reward** – e.g., "Earn 15% for the first sale"
- **Referral link type** – e.g., `refer.dub.co/{partner-link-key}`
- **Website URL** – Where partner links redirect

Use the pencil icon on each card to edit. When everything looks correct, click **Create program**.
