</Frame>

1. **Company name**: The name of your company (e.g., "Acme").
2. **Logo**: Upload a square logo. It appears on your program landing page and in partner materials.
3. **Referral link**: Set the domain and destination for partner links:
   - **Program domain**
     - **Claim a free .link domain**: No setup. Free for one year with your paid account.
     - **Connect a domain you own** DNS setup required. Use a domain dedicated to your program (e.g., `refer.yourcompany.com`).
   - **Website URL**: Where visitors go when they click a partner's referral link (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com`).

Click **Continue** to go to the next step.

## Step 2: Configure rewards

   - **Lead**: For sign-ups and demos.

2. **Commission structure (only for sale rewards)**
   - **Recurring**: Ongoing revenue share (e.g., 15% of each payment for 12 months)
   - **One-off**: Fixed payout per conversion (e.g., $20 per sale)

3. **Duration (only for recurring rewards)**: How long partners earn (e.g., 12 months)

4. **Reward amount**:
   - **Percentage**: Share of revenue (e.g., 15% per sale)
   - **Flat**: Fixed amount per conversion (e.g., $20 per lead)

Select your reward conditions and click **Continue**.

<Tip>
  You can add more [reward conditions](/help/article/partner-rewards) and
  [partner groups](/help/article/partner-groups) later in your program settings.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Invite partners

**Goal**: Invite your first partners to your program.

<Note>
  You can skip this step and [invite partners
  later](/help/article/inviting-partners) from the Partners tab.

2. Click **+ Add partner** to add each one.
3. Click **Continue** to proceed (you can also skip and invite later from the Partners tab).

## Step 4: Help and Support

**Goal**: Add support resources (support email, terms of service, help center) that partners see on their dashboard.

    alt="Help and Support step in Create partner program"
  />
</Frame>

1. **Support email (required)**: Email partners can reach you for questions.
2. **Help center URL**: Link to your help docs or FAQ (e.g. `https://yourcompany.com/help`).
3. **Terms of Service URL**: Link to your affiliate/partner terms (e.g. `https://yourcompany.com/legal/affiliates`).

These appear on the partner dashboard. You can add or update them later in your [program resources tab](/help/article/program-resources).

You'll see a summary of:

- **Referral link type**: e.g. `refer.dub.co/{partner-link-key}`
