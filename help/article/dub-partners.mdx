</Tip>

In today's day and age, especially with the rise of AI, the best ideas and products are no longer sufficient to rise above the competition and become a category leader.

What works is having a powerful distribution network that can produce consistent, repeatable, and profitable results – ideally on autopilot. A good example of this is a product-led partner program, be it a referral or an affiliate program.

Think Dropbox's famous "Refer a friend" program, or Framer's beloved [Partner Program](https://www.framer.com/creators/) that generates [$8M worth of payouts](https://x.com/framer/status/1879207447057125549) annually.

**This is where Dub Partners comes in.**

With Dub Partners, you can build powerful, scalable referral *and* affiliate programs with **1-click global payouts** and **white-labeling functionality**.

## How does Dub Partners work?
Dub Partners is an all-in-one partner management platform for you to scale your revenue by incentivizing both your users and external partners to help spread the word about your product.

With Dub Partners, you can launch both referral and affiliate programs with your users and external partners – all in a single platform.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/program-overview.png" alt="Program Overview" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

This allows you to maximize your revenue growth by partnering with your most avid users and the best content creators in your niche, without needing to manage them in separate systems.

</Step>

<Step title="Flexible reward structures">
With Dub, you can create advanced pay-per-click/lead and rev-share reward structures to drive partner engagement and revenue.

| Reward type                 | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Click-based (pay-per-click) | Rewarding partners for driving clicks to your product – similar to how Google Ads' pay-per-click works.                                           |
| Lead-based (pay-per-lead)   | A more effective alternative to pay-per-click, where you reward partners for leads generated (e.g. demo requests, free trial signups, etc.)        |
| Sale-based (pay-per-sale)   | This is the most common reward type, where you reward partners for driving sales to your product either via a rev-share or fixed-price commission. |

<Step title="1-click global payouts + tax compliance">
Dub Partners supports [1-click payouts](/help/article/partner-payouts) to your partners worldwide.

If you're running a partner program with hundreds of partners, instead of manually sending payouts to each partner, you can use Dub to pay your partners in one click, with [tax-compliance](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-payouts#tax-compliance) built in.

We also provide invoices for each payout, so you can easily track your spend and reconcile your payments.

Here's the list of supported payout countries on Dub:

</Step>
<Step title="Dual-sided incentives">

With Dub Partners, you can create dual-sided incentives for your affiliate/referral programs, which give special discounts to customers who sign up via a referral link.

<Video src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/dub-partners-dual-sided-incentives.mp4" />

Some examples include:
- 25% discount for the first 12 months
- 30% lifetime discount
- $50 one-off discount

This can drive powerful word-of-mouth growth as partners are more likely to share their link if it gives their audience/user base additional discounts, and on the other hand, their users are more likely to click on their links as well if they're getting a special deal.

<Step title="AI landing page generator">
You can also use our intelligent AI landing page generator to create a compelling, branded landing page for your program to drive partner signups.

<Step title="Embedded referral dashboard">
One of the unique features of Dub Partners is the ability to create an embedded referral dashboard directly inside your application.

<Video src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/dub-partners-whitelabeled-embed.mp4" />

This allows you to seamlessly onboard your users to your referral program, without them needing to leave your app and sign up on a third-party platform.
