Dub's link builder comes with powerful features like [UTM builder](/help/article/utm-builder), [device targeting](/help/article/device-targeting), [password protection](/help/article/password-protected-links), [expiration dates](/help/article/link-expiration), and more.

Dub is also the only link management platform that lets you [customize the social media cards](/help/article/custom-link-previews) for your links, so you can have full control over how your links look when shared on social media.

In this article, we will take a look at how you can leverage these features to create your first short link on Dub.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dub link builder">
    
    There are 3 ways to open the [Dub link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder) to create a short link:

    1. **Slowest**: Click on the "Create link" button on the dashboard.
    2. **Faster**: Use the keyboard shortcut `c` to open the link builder.
    3. **Fastest**: Just paste in a valid URL into the dashboard. This will automatically open the link builder and pre-fill the URL field.

    </Frame>

    As you can see, the link builder also gives you a preview of your short link on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and LinkedIn.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your destination URL">
    Enter your destination URL in the "Destination URL" field. You can enter the URL with or without the `https://` protocol – behind the scenes, Dub will automatically make sure it's formatted correctly.
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a short link slug" optional>
    Under the **Short Link** field, you can either:
    1. Enter your own short link slug
    2. Generate a random short link slug
    3. [Generate a short link slug with AI](https://dub.co/blog/introducing-dub-ai).

    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      This step is optional. If you don't enter a short link slug, Dub will generate one for you.
