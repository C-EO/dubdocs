<Tip>
  This feature is only available for [Business plans and
  above](https://dub.co/pricing/partners).
</Tip>

On Dub, you can also create a branded landing page with details about your [partner program](/help/article/dub-partners):

## What is the program landing page?

The program landing page gives your applicants information about your program and the rewards offered. This also includes brand or marketing files, FAQ sections, and any other content you want to add that will help an applicant understand your program, what your product is, and why they should apply.

<Tip>
  On Dub, you can create a custom landing page for each [partner
  group](/help/article/partner-groups) in your program. This is helpful for
  showcasing different information about your program tailored to different
  partner types – e.g. influencers vs affiliates vs resellers.

By default, when you create a new partner group, it reuses the landing page
details from your default partner group, but you can always edit them
afterwards.

</Tip>

## Where to find the landing page builder?

From your **Groups** page, open the group you want to customize the landing page for:

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

From the tab navigation, click **Branding,** then in the content panel, choose **Landing page** to open the editor.

## Editing and adding content

As you hover over the landing page content in the builder, you'll notice that actions will show, allowing you to add, edit, delete, and reorder content blocks within the page.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>
Content above the reward section can only be edited. This is to maintain content
consistency. Content below the **"Apply today"** button can be added, edited,
removed, and reordered. ## Content types Clicking on "Insert block" allows you
to select the content type you want to add.
