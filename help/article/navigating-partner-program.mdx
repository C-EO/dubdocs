## Program pages

### Overview

This is your main program overview page, is the first page you'll want to check to see how your programs are performing.

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="Program overview"
  />
</Frame>

The page has the following sections:

- **Program summary** - find your default referral link and the rewards and discounts you are eligible for on this program. If you want to hide this section, click the **Hide details** button in the top right, and it won't show until you click the button again.
- **Program earnings and payouts** - see how much you've earned over time, and your most recent payouts. The earnings section also allows you to change the date range to view results from further in the past.
- **Link analytics** - View your clicks, leads and sales for this program, keep track of all their activity.
- **Recent earnings** - A detailed breakdown of your most recent earnings and their payout status.

### Links

You'll find all your program referral links on this page, including the clicks, leads, and sales for each.

  />
</Frame>

Clicking on the link card opens a dialog window that will allow you to edit the
short link, destination URL, QR code, and add comments. If you change an
existing short link, be sure to update it wherever it's being shared; otherwise,
the previous short link will stop tracking, and you won't be able to earn any
new rewards for that link.

</Frame>

From this page, you're also able to create new short links by clicking **Create
link** in the top right of this page.

### Resources

Quite often, programs will provide additional assets and resources to help their partners when sharing their referral links.

<Frame>

    alt="Program resources"
  />
</Frame>

The resources are split into three sections:

1. **Brand logos** - These are the official logo and brand files from the program.
2. **Colors** - Make sure you're using the correct hex values in your campaigns or other marketing assets.
3. **Additional files** - This is for anything else that may fall outside of the brand logos and colors. It could be additional marketing images, documents to read, or campaign examples. If anything is missing that you'll need to be successful, make sure to contact the program's support at the [bottom of the program navigation](/help/article/navigating-partner-program#program-help-and-support).

### Earnings

View your earnings performance over time and the details associated with each item.

    alt="Program earnings"
  />
</Frame>
In the top section, you can change the view type by **Link** or **Type**, to be
able to see which links are performing better, or which reward type has earned
more (pending the program offers rewards for clicks, leads, and sales).

### Analytics

View your program performance analytics, and filter and organize by clicks, leads, and sales.

#### Data toggle

You can change the data displayed by clicking the `123 | $` toggle in the top right of the data type section.

By default `$` is selected, as it is related directly to your reward earnings. Switching to `123` will change any monetary values to their specific reward count. If the program you're on has other monetary rewards (clicks, leads, sales), their dollar amount will show as well.

When the chart type is switched to **conversion funnel**, you can view the percentage of customers that complete each stage of the sales conversion. In this example, 0.58% of clicks have resulted in a referral making a purchase.

#### Aggregated data for different facets (top views)

These are more commonly known as the "Top Views" in Dub Analytics. These views show your top links, countries, cities, devices, and more.

- **Links** - Short Links and Destination URLs
- **Referrals** - Referrers and UTM Parameters
- **Location** - Countries, Cities, Regions, and Continents
- **Tech** - Devices, Browser, OS, and Triggers

### Events

View your program events, and filter and organize by clicks, leads, and sales. Dub's real-time events stream is a detailed, real-time stream of events across each program you've joined.

You can filter this data, select a different date range, and change the data
shown by clicking on Clicks, Leads, and Sales in the top section.

## Program help and support

Every program provides email support for its partners and the questions you have that are specific to the program. Optionally, a program may also provide a link to the help documentation and up-to-date terms of service.
