If you're not sure where a Dub link will take you, you can check its destination before clicking on it by adding a `+` sign to the end of the short link.

For example, if you want to check the destination of the short link `d.to/github`, you can type `d.to/github+` into your browser's address bar and press `Enter`.

This will take you to a page that shows you the destination URL of the short link, as well as the respective social media preview for the URL.

## Reporting a malicious link

If you suspect that a Dub link is malicious, you can report it by clicking on the `🚩` button on the link inspector page.
