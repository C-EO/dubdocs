[Content creators](https://dub.co/solutions/creators) on Dub create thousands of short links daily for the brands they work with. Oftentimes, these brands would also use their own link shorteners/affiliate links, which the creator would then shorten with [their own branded domains](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain).

However, platforms like [PixelMe](https://www.pixelme.app/) restrict this, which means you're forced to use the generic short links used by the brands you work with.

On Dub, **double link directs work out of the box**. This means you can easily create short links for any brand you work with, which gives you several benefits:

1. [**Improved brand recognition**](https://dub.co/blog/custom-domains): Instead of sharing a generic `brandname.xyz` link, you can share something like `yourname.link/brand`, which helps builds trust with your audience.
2. [**Real-time click analytics**](https://dub.co/analytics): Dub gives you accurate real-time click data that you can leverage to negotiate higher revenue with the brands you work with.
