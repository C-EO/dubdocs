At Dub, we understand that "time is money".

Imagine you've created a dozen links for a marketing campaign, but you realized that you forgot to assign them to a tag when creating them.

Instead of [manually tagging them in the link builder](/help/article/how-to-use-tags), what if you could _tag all of them at once_?

With bulk link actions, you can do exactly that.

## Bulk selecting links

To select a link, hover over the logo of the link and click on it. A check mark will show up in lieu of the link logo, and a selection toolbar will appear at the bottom of your screen:

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/select-single-link.png"
  alt=""
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

You can also select multiple links at once with `SHIFT` + `CLICK`:

<Frame>
  <video

    loop
    autoPlay
    muted
    playsInline
  />
</Frame>

## Updating links in bulk

Then, once you've selected your links, you can use the toolbar to [perform bulk actions](#supported-bulk-link-actions) on the selected links:

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/bulk-links-toolbar.png"
  alt=""
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

<Tip>Hitting `ESC` deselect all currently selected links.</Tip>
