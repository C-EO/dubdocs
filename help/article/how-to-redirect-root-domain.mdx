When you add a custom domain to your workspace, Dub.co will automatically create a placeholder page for your domain. This page will be displayed when you visit your domain.

To redirect your domain to a URL of your choice, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, upgrade to the [Pro plan](/help/article/pro-plan).
2. Navigate to your workspace's Domains page – you can do that by clicking on the **Domains** link in the menu bar at the top of your workspace dashboard.
3. Click on the `⋮` button next to the domain you want to redirect, which will open a dropdown menu.

4. In the dropdown menu, click on the **Edit Link** button, which will open the [Dub link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder) for the root domain link.
5. Enter the URL you want to redirect your domain to in the **Destination URL** field.
