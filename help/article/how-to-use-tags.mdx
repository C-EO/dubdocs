Tags are a great way to organize your links on Dub. You can use tags to group links together and make it easier to find them later.

## What is a Tag?

A tag is a label that you can assign to a link. Tags are color-coded and can be created and assigned to a link in just a few clicks.

With tags, you can:

1. Organize your links by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
2. Filter your links by tags and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
3. [Filter your analytics by tags](/help/article/filter-analytics-by-tags) to see how your campaigns are performing.

## How to create a Tag

To create a tag, navigate to the [Tags settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/library/tags) in your Dub workspace.

Click on **Create Tag** to open up the tag creation modal, where you can create a new tag and choose a color for it:

/>

You can also create new tags directly inside the [Dub link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder). Once you've [created a link](/help/article/how-to-create-link), click on the tag input field and type in the name of the tag you want to create.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

If the tag already exists, you can select it from the dropdown. Otherwise, press `Enter ↩` to create a new tag.

Once the tag is created, click on the "Create Link" button to assign the tag to the link.

## How to edit or delete a Tag

Tags can be edited via the [Tags settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/library/tags) in your Dub workspace.

Simply click on the `⋮` button to open the menu popover for the tag, which gives you the following options:

- Edit the tag
- Copy the tag's unique ID (for [programmatic API use](/help/article/how-to-use-tags#managing-tags-programmatically))
- Delete the tag

You can also use the following keyboard shortcuts to manage your tags:

| `E`               | Edit a tag               |

| `X`               | Delete a tag             |

To open the tag editing modal, click on the "Edit" button. Inside the tag editing modal, you can:
