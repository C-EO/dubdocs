On Dub, you can filter your analytics by [UTM parameters](/help/article/utm-builder). This allows you to create powerful campaign-specific reports for your links.

For example, you're leveraging our [UTM templates feature](/help/article/how-to-create-utm-templates) to create standardized UTM parameters for your team to use in their marketing campaigns, you'd want a way to see how each of these UTMs are performing in your Analytics tab.

With our **UTM Parameters** tab, you can easily see how each of your UTM parameters are performing in real time.
