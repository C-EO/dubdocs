Device targeting is a powerful feature that lets you personalize the destination URL for your links based on the user's device type.

For example, you can set a custom destination URL for iOS devices by toggling the "iOS Targeting" switch in the [link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder), and a different URL for Android devices by toggling the "Android Targeting" switch in the link builder.

To use this feature, click on the **Targeting** button in the link builder. This will open a new modal with device targeting options.

You can also quickly access the Targeting feature by using the keyboard shortcut `G` while in the link builder.

This is particularly useful if you want to send iOS users to the App Store to download your iOS app, and Android users to the Google Play Store to download your Android app.

In both cases, the main **Destination URL** will be used as the fallback URL that will be used if the user's device type does not match the targeting rules.
