Custom domains are a great way to [improve the click-through rates of your short links](https://dub.co/blog/custom-domains). They are especially useful if you want to use a domain that is relevant to your audience and content.

On Dub, you can add custom domains for free. The number of domains that you can add depends on your plan:

- **Free plan**: 3 domains
- [**Pro plan**](https://dub.co/pricing): 10 domains
- [**Business plan**](https://dub.co/pricing): 40 domains
- **Enterprise plan**: Unlimited domains

## Which custom domain should I choose for my short link?

When choosing a custom domain for your short links, consider the following factors:

1. **Brand**: Choose a domain that best reflects your brand – ideally containing your brand name in it. For example, if your company domain is `jupiter.com`, you can use a domain like `jupiter.link` or `go.jupiter.com`.
2. **Length**: Shorter domains are easier to remember and type. To achieve this, some companies might opt for acronyms or abbreviations. For example, one of our customers [Tinybird](https://dub.co/customers/tinybird) uses `tbrd.co` for their short domain.

<Tip>
  The only exception here is you're going for a `.link` TLD, or a `go.`
  subdomain, which are both slightly longer than your original domain.

Here are some examples of custom domains that you can use for your short links – based on what we've seen [our customers](https://dub.co/customers) use:

| Option         | Format          | Real-world examples                                                                                                             | Usage on Dub |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Subdomains     | `go.domain.com` | **Clerk** → `go.clerk.com`<br/>**Nuxt** → `go.nuxt.com`<br/>**Cal.com** → `go.cal.com`<br/>**Causal** → `go.causal.app`         | 32.1%        |
| Different TLDs | `domain.link`   | **Framer** → `framer.link`<br/>**Supabase** → `supabase.link`<br/>**Vercel** → `vercel.fyi`<br/>**Replicate** → `replicate.fyi` | 6.6%         |
| Domain hacks   | `doma.in`       | **Basedash** → `baseda.sh`<br/>**Inngest** → `innge.st`<br/>**Lugg** → `lu.gg`<br/>**Crowdin** → `crowd.in`                     | 1.9%         |

### Option 1: Use a subdomain

This is the easiest option to get started with – especially since you don't need to buy a new domain. Plus, using a subdomain is also better for ownership verification since users can be certain that the domain is owned by your entity (as opposed to a separate domain like `company.tld`).

For instance, if you're using `domain.com` for your main website, you can [use a subdomain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2b-adding-a-subdomain) like `go.domain.com` for your short links.

Some real-world examples of this are:

- **Clerk** → `go.clerk.com`
- **Nuxt** → `go.nuxt.com`
- **Cal.com** → `go.cal.com`
- **Causal** → `go.causal.app`

<Note>
  At the time of writing, 1,293 out of 4,024 verified domains on Dub use a
  subdomain for their short links – a 31% usage rate.
</Note>

### Option 2: Use a different TLD

Alternatively, you can use a different top-level domain (TLD) like `.link` or `.fyi` for your short links. With this option, you get to use a similar length domain – if not shorter – for your short links, with the trade-off being that you'll need to scoop out a few extra dollars for the additional domain.

For example, if you're using `domain.com` for your main website, you can use a TLD like `domain.link` for your short links.

Some real-world examples of this are:

- **Framer** → `framer.link`
- **Supabase** → `supabase.link`
- **Vercel** → `vercel.fyi`
- **Replicate** → `replicate.fyi`

<Note>
  At the time of writing, 266 out of 4,024 verified domains on Dub use a
  different TLD for their short links – a 6.6% usage rate.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you're on a [Pro plan](https://dub.co/pricing) or higher, you can also claim a [complimentary .link custom domain](/help/article/free-dot-link-domain) and use it as your short link domain.

### Option 3: Use a domain hack

Last but not least, you can get creative with your short link domain by using a domain hack. This is a technique where you split your company name into two parts and use the first part as the domain and the second part as the top-level domain (TLD).

For example, if you're using `domain.com` for your main website, you can use a domain hack like `doma.in` for your short links.

Some real-world examples of this are:

- **Basedash** → `baseda.sh`
- **Inngest** → `innge.st`
- **Lugg** → `lu.gg`
- **Crowdin** → `crowd.in`

<Note>
  At the time of writing, 78 out of 4,024 verified domains on Dub use a domain
  hack for their short links – a 1.9% usage rate.
