<Tip>
  This feature is only available for [Business plans and above](/pricing/partners).
</Tip>

## Where to find your referral link settings
Each [partner group](/help/article/partner-groups) has its own referral link settings. To find them, open a group and click **Links** in the top navigation.

## Default referral links
A default link is created during program setup, so new [partner groups](/help/article/partner-groups) always have a referral link. You can also set up additional default links that are automatically created when a partner is enrolled in the partner group.

Click **Create Link** to add more default links:

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/default-links.png" alt="Group default links" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

<Info>
When creating a default link, you'll be asked to enter a **Destination URL**. This is the page users land on after clicking a referral link. It’s often your homepage or a dedicated program landing page.
</Info>

**Default Link Behavior**
- **When you create a default link**, a new link is generated for every partner in that group. This includes both current and future partners in that group.
- **When you update a default link's** destination URL, it updates all the corresponding partner links in that group with the destination URL you set.
- **When you delete a default link**, the link remains for existing partners in that group to ensure historical stats/commissions are preserved. 

## Additional partner links
You can also let your partners create their own links beyond the defaults:

For your additional partner links, you can specify the following:
- **Link limit**: the maximum number of links partners can create
- **Link domains**: the domains that your partner's links must match (either any page on that domain, or the homepage only)

<Warning>
Ensure the domain you're adding has conversion tracking set up, or your links won't be tracking correctly. [Learn more here.](https://dub.co/docs/partners/quickstart)
</Warning>

### 

## Link settings
Define the link structure and UTM parameters for all partners in the group.

### Link structure
Dub supports two referral link formats. Choose based on how you want links to look and where they’ll be shared. Both formats work the same for attribution.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/link-structure.png" alt="Link structure" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

<Info>
You can use any of the referral link types interchangeably – the option above is to determine which format is shown in the partner dashboard.
</Info>

**Option 1: Short Links**

**Format:** `getacme.link/{partnerName}`

A clean, branded short link that’s easy to remember and perfect for sharing in social posts, bios, or messages.

<Tip>
We recommend using short links for several reasons:
1. Some web browsers block [client-side click tracking](https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking), which breaks attribution – with `getacme.link/john` the click will be tracked server-side too, which improves attribution accuracy
2. Some web browsers drop query params, which breaks attribution as well
3. It's cleaner ✨
</Tip>

**Option 2: Query Parameter**

**Format:** `acme.com?via={partnerName}`

Appends the partner name as a query string on your destination URL. Ideal for users who are [migrating from Rewardful](/help/article/migrating-from-rewardful) and want to maintain backwards compatibility for existing partner links.

### UTM parameters
Set default [UTM parameters](/help/article/utm-builder) for all links in this group. This gives you group-specific insights in analytics.
<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/link-utm.png" alt="Link UTM" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />
#### 
When you update a group’s [UTM template](/help/article/how-to-create-utm-templates), all partner links in the group are refreshed and overwritten with the new UTM tags.

## How partner group changes affect referral links

As mentioned earlier, a partner's link settings are tied to the [partner group](/help/article/partner-groups) they're in. When you update a partner's group, or delete groups, their partner links will be updated as well.

### Moving partners to a group
When a partner is moved to a new group, their links automatically update to match the new group’s defaults and UTM parameters.

<Info>
**Why would you move partners?**
- To promote them from a starter group to a group with a higher reward tier
- To try out new rewards in a test group
- To tidy up your structure and general reorganization
</Info>

### Deleting groups
If you delete a group, all partners in that group are moved to the default group. Their links are updated to match the default group’s settings. 

<Info>
**Why would you delete a group?**
- The campaign has ended
- You created a duplicate group by mistake
- A beta trial group is no longer needed
</Info>
