If you're familiar with SEO best practices, you might have heard of the `noindex` meta tag that tells search engines not to index a page.

This is particularly important if you're using Dub with a [custom domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) – specifically a [subdomain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2b-adding-a-subdomain) – for your short links, since having them indexed could potentially have a negative impact on your SEO.

To prevent this, Dub automatically serves short links with a `noindex` response header when you're using a custom domain. This tells search engines not to index your short links, keeping them out of search results.

```bash
GET /noindex HTTP/2
Host: d.to
User-Agent: curl/8.6.0

HTTP/2 302
location: https://dub.co/help/article/how-noindex-works
X-Robots-Tag: noindex # [!code highlight]
X-Powered-By: Dub.co
```

<Info>
  If you're using Dub with a [default Dub-branded
  domain](/help/article/default-dub-domains) (e.g. `dub.sh`, `git.new`), the
  `noindex` response header is **_not applied by default_**.

## How to index your short links on Google

If you would like your short links to be indexed anyway, you can easily enable indexing by following these steps:

1. Go to your [Dub dashboard](https://d.to/register).
2. Click on the `⋮` button of the link that you want to enable indexing for, which will open the dropdown menu.
3. In the dropdown menu, click on the **Edit** button, which will open the [Dub link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder).
4. Click on the `...` button, which will open the dropdown menu.
5. In the dropdown menu, click on the **Add Search Engine Indexing** button to enable indexing.

And that's it! Your link will now be served without the `noindex` response header:

```bash
GET /doindex HTTP/2
Host: d.to
User-Agent: curl/8.6.0

HTTP/2 302
location: https://dub.co/help/article/how-noindex-works
X-Powered-By: Dub.co
```
