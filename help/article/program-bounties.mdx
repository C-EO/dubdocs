| Input                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start date (optional)  | Bounty start date. Partners will receive an email notification on this date about the bounty. If one is not selected, the bounty will start on the creation date.                     |
| End date (optional)    | Bounty end date. If set, bounty will "expire" after the end date and will no longer be eligible for commission.                                                                       |
| Description (optional) | Provide additional bounty details. E.g. "This is a one-time promotional period for you to earn additional commissions on top of what you're already earning with our program"         |
| Logic                  | The success criteria are based on: total leads, total conversions, total revenue, or total commissions. [Learn more](/help/article/program-bounties#performance-logic).               |
| Reward                 | The reward amount the partner will receive upon completing the bounty.                                                                                                                |
| Groups                 | [Partner group](/help/article/partner-groups) eligibility. The same bounty can be applied to multiple [partner groups](/help/article/partner-groups) – or all groups in your program. |

### Performance logic

When setting the logic for a performance bounty, you can choose from several options depending on how you want performance to be measured.

<Frame>

    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/performance-logic-3.png"
    alt="Performance bounty logic"
  />
</Frame>

**Scope** determines how performance is tracked over a specific period.

- **New** - Tracks only performance generated after the bounty is created. For example, if you set a bounty that rewards partners after 10 leads, each partner must generate 10 new leads after the bounty goes live, regardless of how many leads they had before.
- **Lifetime** - Counts performance across the partner’s entire lifetime. For example, if you set a bounty that rewards after 10 leads, any partner who already has at least 10 leads will immediately qualify for the reward.

**Activity** determines which metric is tracked for the bounty. Revenue and commissions require a dollar amount to be set.

- Leads
- Conversions
- Revenue
- Commissions

## Submission bounties

Submission bounties reward partners for completing activities that require review, such as creating social media content, publishing a blog post, or hosting an event. Partners submit proof, and rewards are approved once requirements are met.

### Manual submission

Manual submission is best used for when you want to reward partners for specific actions or achievements, such as publishing a blog post highlighting your product or hosting an event (in-person or online) promoting your brand.

During bounty creation, you can optionally require partners to include images
and URLs as part of their submission.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/dub-partners/manual-submission.png"
    alt="Submission requirements"
  />
</Frame>

By default, partners claiming a manual submission reward are asked to describe how they completed the bounty using a text field.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/submission-default-2.png"
    alt="Submission default"
  />
</Frame>

#### Require at least one image

When enabled, partners must upload at least one
image as part of their submission. Up to four images can be included.

#### Require at least one URL

Require at least one URL When enabled, partners must include at least one URL in
their submission. Up to 100 URLs can be provided.

#### Allowed domains

You can restrict submissions to specific domains by defining an allowed domain list.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/dub-partners/allowed-domains.png" alt="Allowed domains" />
</Frame>
This is helpful when submissions must come from specific platforms or websites,
such as approved social networks or owned domains.

<Tip>
  Looking to run bounties for social posts with outcome-based rewards? Check out
  the [social metrics submission type](#social-metrics) instead.
</Tip>

#### Custom reward

For certain submission bounties, you may want to have a custom reward for each submission. Here are some examples:

- Pay a custom reward amount for an arbitrary task (e.g. organizing a meetup/webinar)
- Reward 10% if the partner reaches a goal they set by a specific date (e.g. [#FramerChallenge](https://www.framer.com/challenge/))

    alt="Create submission bounty"

</Frame>

### Social metrics

Social metric submissions are best used for when you want to reward partners based on the performance of their social posts. Their performance is automatically tracked and measured against your set criteria.

When submitting these bounties, the partner can only provide one link, and it's required to be from a verified account on their profile.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/dub-partners/social-metric-empty.png"
    alt="Social metric — empty state (no data)"
  />
</Frame>

#### Select a social platform and target metric

You can track performance on one social platform per bounty, and can select from:

- YouTube
- Instagram
- TikTok
- X/Twitter

And for each social platform, you can track either likes or views.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/dub-partners/social-metric.png"
    alt="Social metric — populated state with platform and target metric selected"
  />
</Frame>

#### Add a variable bonus

You can also optionally reward for additional performance beyond the base criteria.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/dub-partners/social-metric-variable.png"
    alt="Social metric — variable bonus configuration"
  />
</Frame>

In this example, the program is rewarding an additional \$5 per 100 views on the submitted post, up to 1,000 views.

## Reviewing bounties

For submission bounties, you can review your partner's submissions before approving or rejecting. To do that, you can open their submission from the Bounty submission table and review their submission details, file uploads, and links

<Frame>

    alt="Bounty review table"
  />
</Frame>

### Approve submission

Once you approve a bounty submission, a [commission](/help/article/partner-commissions) will be automatically created and due at your next payout. The partner will also receive a notification email:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/bounty-approved-email.png"
    alt="Bounty approved email"
  />
</Frame>
<Info>
  If you set your reward to **custom** during the approval process, you'll be
  asked to enter the flat rate amount to reward this partner.
</Info>

### Reject submission

To reject a bounty submission, you’ll need to select a reason and can optionally add more details. No commission will be created, rejection details are added to the submission records, and the partner will also receive a notification email:
