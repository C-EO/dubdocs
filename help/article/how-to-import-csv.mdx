You can also import your existing links into Dub via our CSV import feature. This is useful if you have a large list of links to import or if you want to [import links from another provider](/help/article/migrating-from-bitly) that we don't have a 1-click importer for.

To import your links, you can follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Prepare your CSV file">

Before you import your CSV file, make sure it is in the correct format. Your CSV file needs to have the following data:

| Column          | Required | Description                                                    | Example                   |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Destination URL | **Yes**  | The destination URL of the link you want to import.            | `https://www.google​.com` |
| Short link      | **Yes**  | The shortened version of the link.                             | `yourdomain.com/abc123`   |
| Title           | No       | The title of the link.                                         | `Google`                  |
| Description     | No       | The description of the link.                                   | `Search the web`          |
| Tags            | No       | The tags of the link – must be a comma-separated list of tags. | `search, google, web`     |
| Creation date   | No       | The date the link was created.                                 | `2024-01-01`              |

The actual names of your columns can be anything you want, but you need to make sure that the required columns are present.

</Step>

<Step title="Upload your CSV file">

If you haven't already, [create a workspace on Dub.co](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace).

<Info>
  **Protip**: Once you create your workspace, we generally recommend you **_not
  to [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain)_** until
  you've migrated all your links. This will prevent any potential downtime for
  your links.
</Info>

Then, from your [links dashboard](https://d.to/register), click on the `⋮` button next to the **Create Link** button and select **Import from CSV**.

This will open a modal with a file uploader.

  alt="CSV import modal"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

Upload your CSV file, and you should be automatically redirected to the next step.

</Step>

<Step title="Review the AI-generated column mappings">

When you upload a CSV file, [Dub AI](https://dub.co/blog/introducing-dub-ai) will automatically map the columns in your CSV file to the [supported data fields in Dub](/docs/data-model#links).

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/help/import-csv-modal-mapping.png"
  alt="CSV import column mapping"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

You can then review and edit the mappings before selecting **Confirm import**. In just a few seconds, all your links will be migrated to Dub.co.

Alternatively, you can also select **Choose another file** to upload a different CSV file.

</Step>

<Step title="Review the import summary">

Once all your links have been imported, we will send you an email to let you know that the migration is complete.

  alt="Email notification about completed CSV import"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

If there are any issues with the import, we will send you a separate email with the details of the errors.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain">

Once all your links are imported, you can [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) by setting the right DNS records. Once this is done, you can start using your links!
