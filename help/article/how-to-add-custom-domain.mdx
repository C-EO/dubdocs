## Complimentary .link custom domain

If you're on a paid plan on Dub ([Pro plan](https://dub.co/pricing) and above), you can claim a [complimentary .link custom domain](/help/article/free-dot-link-domain) and use it as your short link domain – no DNS setup needed.

Read our guide on [how to claim your free .link domain on Dub](/help/article/free-dot-link-domain).

## Step 1: Add a custom domain

Once you have a custom domain, you can add it to your Dub workspace by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your workspace's Domains page – you can do that by clicking on the **Domains** link in the menu bar at the top of your workspace dashboard.
2. Click on the **Add Domain** button.
3. Enter the domain you want to use and click **Add domain**.

## Step 2: Configure your domain

After adding your domain, you'll be presented with a DNS record that you'll need to add to your domain's DNS settings.

  />

## Step 2a: Adding an apex domain

If you're adding an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`), you'll need to add an `A` record with the following values:

- **Name**: `@` (or leave it blank)
- **Value**: `76.76.21.21`
- **TTL**: `86400` (or the highest value possible)

## Step 2b: Adding a subdomain

If you're adding a subdomain (e.g. `go.example.com`), you'll need to add a `CNAME` record with the following values:

- **Name**: `go` (or whatever subdomain you want to use)
- **Value**: `cname.dub.co`
- **TTL**: `86400` (or the highest value possible)

Note that we do not support using `www.` as a subdomain, since the `www.` subdomain will always redirect to the apex domain instead.

We recommend using the following variations for your subdomains:

- `go.example.com`
- `try.example.com`
- `links.example.com`
- `l.example.com`

<Warning>
  If you're using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you might need to configure
  some extra steps for it to work properly. Please refer to our guide on [using
  Cloudflare domains with Dub](/help/article/using-cloudflare-domains) for more
  information.
</Warning>

## Step 3 (optional): Verify domain ownership

<Info>
  This step is only applicable if you are adding a domain that is currently
  being used on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
</Info>

Since we use Vercel as the DNS provider for Dub, you'll need to verify that you own the domain before you can add it to your Dub workspace.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/vercel-domain.png"
    alt="Verifying domain ownership on Dub"
  />
</Frame>

To do that, you'll need to add a TXT record with the following values:

- **Name**: `_vercel`
- **Value**: `vc-domain-verify=go.yourdomain.com...` (the value will be provided to you on the Dub dashboard)

<Warning>
  Warning: If you are using this domain for another site, setting this TXT
  record will transfer domain ownership away from that site and break it. Please
  exercise caution when setting this record.
  <></>
  For example: Make sure that the domain that is shown in the TXT verification
  value (e.g. `go.yourdomain.com`) is actually the domain you want to use as a
  custom domain on Dub – and ***not your production site***.
</Warning>

## How long do I have to wait for my domain to work?

Domain configuration can take anywhere between 1 to 24 hours to complete. If your domain still doesn't work after 24 hours, please [send us an email](mailto:support@dub.co?subject=Domain%20not%20working) and we'll be happy to help you out.
