Transferring links between workspaces is a common use case for many Dub users, especially when they want to reorganize their links or consolidate them into a single workspace.

This guide will show you how to transfer your Dub short links from one workspace to another.

<Warning>
  Transferring a link will also **fully reset its stats** and is irreversible
  – please proceed with caution.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Open the link transfer modal

For a given link, click on the `⋮` button and select **Transfer**.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

You can also use the `T` keyboard shortcut to open the transfer modal.

## Step 2: Select the destination workspace

In the transfer modal, select the workspace you want to transfer the link to:

Click on **Confirm transfer** to complete the transfer.

That's it! Your link should now be successfully transferred to the new workspace.

## Caveats

- Transferring a link will also **fully reset its stats** and is irreversible – please proceed with caution.
- You can only transfer [default Dub domains](/help/article/default-dub-domains) (e.g. \`dub.sh\`, \`chatg.pt\`, \`spti.fi\`, \`amzn.id\`, etc.) between workspaces. If you want to transfer a custom domain link, you'll need to [transfer the domain](/help/article/how-to-transfer-domains) itself to the new workspace.
- Link tags are not transferred when you transfer a link between workspaces. You'll need to re-apply the tags to the link in the new workspace.
- You can only transfer links to workspaces that you have access to. If you don't have access to the destination workspace, you won't be able to transfer the link.
