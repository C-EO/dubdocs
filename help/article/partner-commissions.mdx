## Where to find your program commissions?
When viewing your Partner Program navigation, click on the **Commissions** page, under the **Insights** group:

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/commission-dashboard-1.png" alt="Commissions page within your dashboard" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

This opens up the commissions table view, where you can see a list of your historical commissions for your program:

| Column       | Data                  |

| Additional actions | Actions to mark the commission as duplicate, fraud, or canceled |

## Commission statuses
When a commission is recorded on Dub, it goes through the following statuses:
- `Pending`: This is the initial status for a commission. Depending on your program's [holding period](/help/article/partner-payouts#payout-holding-period), commissions can stay in "pending" status anywhere from less than a day to 90 days.
- `Processed`: When a commission has been added to a payout (after any applicable [holding period](/help/article/partner-payouts#payout-holding-period)), its status will change from "pending" to "processed".
- `Paid`: When the payout containing the commission has been paid, the commission will be updated to "paid" status.

If needed, you can also update the status for a given commission accordingly:
- `Refunded`: If the sale for the commission was refunded. This is usually automatically detected via our [Stripe integration](https://dub.co/integrations/stripe), or can also be manually set via the dashboard or the [API](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-commission).
- `Fraud`: If a commission event was found to be fraudulent, you can mark them as "Fraud" via the dashboard or the [API](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-commission). **This action cannot be undone.**
- `Canceled`: If a commission event was canceled/voided (e.g. in cases of self-referrals where commissions are not eligible for payout), you can mark them as "Canceled" via the dashboard or the [API](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-commission). **This action cannot be undone.**
- `Duplicate`: If a commission event was found to be a duplicate, you can mark them as "Duplicate" via the dashboard or the [API](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-commission). **This action cannot be undone.**

## Creating manual commissions

Occasionally,  you might need to create a one-off or recurring commission to account for a missed commission or other reasons. On Dub, you can easily create those commissions via the dashboard, and they will be included in the next payout for that partner.

This can be accomplished by clicking **Create commission** from your **Commissions** page.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-commission-main.png" alt="Create one-time commission" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

It can also be accomplished by clicking **Create commission** from an individual partner profile
<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-commission-partner.png" alt="Create one-time commission" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

### One-time commissions
Manual one-time commissions are often used when you want to send a thank-you or bonus, fix a missed commission due to a clerical or tracking error, or create a payout that isn’t tied to a customer, referral link, or transaction.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-commission-onetime-01.png" alt="Create one-time commission" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

| Input | Description  | Required |

| Amount  | Commission amount  | ✅ |
| Description  | Add a custom description | ❌ |
| Commission date | Enable to add a custom date. If a custom date isn't added, it will auto-fill to the current date and time | ❌ |

### Lead commission
Manual lead commissions are one-time and based on your [reward settings](/help/article/partner-rewards), so the commission is automatically calculated. Use this for rewarding a partner for a qualified signup or referral. If your program doesn't have a lead reward, this option won't show.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-commission-lead-01.png" alt="Create one-time commission" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

| Lead event name | The name of the lead event. | ❌ |

### Recurring sale commission
Manual sale commissions are recurring and based on your [reward settings](/help/article/partner-rewards), so the partner commission is calculated automatically after entering the sale amount. Sale commissions also create a `sale event` under your analytics, and updates your revenue statistics.

### Creating a new customer
If the customer you need to associate the commission with doesn't exist, you can create a customer in Dub to match your customer records.

Once the customer is created, you can then associate any commissions to them, and future commissions will automatically be associated with that customer.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/create-new-customer-01.png" alt="Create customer modal" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

| Stripe Customer ID | Add a Stripe customer ID to attribute recurring sales to the partner | ❌ |

#### Importing customers from Stripe

If you've already [connected to Stripe](https://dub.co/docs/conversions/sales/stripe#stripe), you can import your customer by clicking on **Import from Stripe**. This will allow you to search existing Stripe customers by their email, and click to import their details into Dub.

<Tip>
  If a customer with the same Stripe Customer ID already exists in Dub, you won't be able to import that customer.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/import-customer-from-stripe-01.png" alt="Importing a Stripe customer" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

Once selected, it will auto-fill the customer profile details. Click **Create customer** to add them to Dub.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/import-customer-from-stripe-02.png" alt="Importing a Stripe customer" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />


### Importing commissions from Stripe invoices

During the commission creation flow, you can choose between the following options:
1. **Create new events**: Create a new sale event entirely.
2. **Import from Stripe**: Create commissions from the customer's existing Stripe invoice payment events

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/import-invoices-from-stripe-01.png" alt="Importing invoices from Stripe" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

Then, once you click **Create commission**, this will import the customer's paid invoices and record them as sale events + partner commissions to their [customer page](help/article/customer-insights).

## Creating a clawback
In the event an incorrect commission has been paid to a partner, you can create a clawback commission, which results in a negative commission for the partner and is subtracted from their next payout.

To create a clawback, click the **More button** next to **Create commissions**, then **Create clawback**.

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/commissions-dropdown.png" alt="Commissions dropdown" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

Fields required to create a clawback:
- **Partner**: The partner receiving the clawback
- **Amount**: The clawback amount
- **Clawback reason:**
    - Order canceled
    - Fraud
    - Terms violation
    - Tracking error
    - Payment failed
    - Ineligible partner
    - Duplicate commission
    - Other

After the clawback is created, you'll see a negative commission in your table view:

<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/clawback-created.png" alt="Clawback created" className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" />

The partner affected will see this reflected in their earnings view on their dashboard:
