<Warning>
Merging your accounts is a permanent action and cannot be undone once it's complete.
</Warning>
## Reasons to merge accounts
There are some reasons why you want to merge your partner accounts on Dub:
- **Consolidate accounts:** You were enrolled in 2 affiliate programs on Dub under different emails.
- **Simplify management**: You want to be able to manage your payouts, programs, and reporting all from one place.
- **Stay compliant**: For compliance reasons, having multiple partner accounts on Dub is strictly prohibited [as per our terms](/legal/partners). We recommend merging your partner accounts to stay compliant.

Clicking this will open a dialog window that has 3 steps to merging your account.
## Steps to merge
<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm account email addresses">

Enter the email addresses of the accounts you'd like to merge. You'll need to have access to both email accounts to verify them.

  alt="Source and target account emails"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

There are two fields to complete:

- **Source account** - the email address of the account you want to merge into the `target account`
- **Target account** - the email address of the account you want the `source account` to merge into

Once these have been added, click **Send codes** to continue the verification process.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify the email addresses">
We'll send an email to each address with a OTP (one-time password) that will be input on this step.

The emails will look like this:

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>
Enter the OTP for each email address into their required field, and click
**Verify accounts** to confirm the codes.

</Step>
<Step title="Final merge confirmation">
This is the final step to confirm the accounts are correct and that you still want to merge. At this point, you're still able to cancel the merge, and nothing will change.

If everything looks good, click **Merge accounts**, and the merge will be completed instantly.
