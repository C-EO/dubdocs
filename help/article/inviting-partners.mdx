There are a few ways you can invite partners to join your affiliate/referral program on Dub Partners:

1. [Inviting via the dashboard](#inviting-via-the-dashboard)
2. [Enrolling a partner automatically](#enrolling-a-partner-automatically)
3. [Via a branded application form](#via-a-branded-application-form)

## Inviting via the dashboard

The easiest way to invite a partner to join your program is by sending them an invitation email.

To do that, go to your [program's](https://app.dub.co/programs) Partners tab and select **Invite Partner**.

This will open the partner invite sheet, where you can enter the partner's name, email, and optionally select the [group](/help/article/partner-groups) they're being added to.

### Updating invitation email

You're also able to edit the email that is sent to the invited partner. To do this, click **Edit** on the email preview section, and open the editor.

<Frame>

</Frame>

You can change the email subject, title, and content for the invite. Changes made here don't replace the default content.

In the content editor you can change the styling of the text using the Bold and Italic buttons at the bottom, or add a link to your text. If you prefer markdown, we also support the following styles:

| Type              | Markdown                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Bold              | `**Bold text**`                  |
| Italic            | `*italic text*`                  |
| Inline Hyperlinks | `[Dub](https://dub.co)`          |
| Bulleted lists    | `1. First item` `2. Second item` |
| Ordered lists     | `- First item` `- Second item`   |
| Blockquote        | `> Content shows here`           |

Click **Save** to update the email content, or **Cancel** to revert back to the default content.

Once your invite is ready to send, click on **Send invite**. Your partner will receive an email in their inbox to join your program.

  brandability? [Reach out to support](mailto:support@dub.co) to get early
  access.
</Tip>

### Viewing past invites

To view your previous invites, click the **Filter** button in the top left of the Partners table, click **Status**, then **Invited**.

<Frame>

</Frame>

This will filter the partners by your invited partners, where you can resend your previous invites if needed.

<Info>
  To prevent spamming inboxes, you can only resend an invite every 24 hours.
</Info>

## Enrolling a partner automatically

Instead of sending an invitation email and waiting for them to accept it, you can also automatically enroll known partners in your program.

<Frame>

    loop
    autoPlay
    muted
    playsInline
  />
</Frame>

A few use cases for this approach:

- Programmatically adding your apps users to your [in-app referral program](/docs/partners/embedded-referrals)
- Migrating your partners over from another platform like [Rewardful](/help/article/migrating-from-rewardful)

If you're integrating with Dub Partners programatically, you can use our [POST /partners API endpoint](/docs/api-reference/endpoint/create-a-partner) to enroll a partner into your program via our API.

<Warning>
  Before auto-enrolling a partner to your program, make sure to get their
  consent – either explicitly or via the acceptance of your Terms of Service.
  Enrolling partners that are unfamiliar with your program is against our [terms
  of service](https://dub.co/legal/terms).
</Warning>

## Via a branded application form

Alternatively, you can also have your partners apply via a branded application form:

<Frame>
  <video

    loop
    autoPlay
    muted
    playsInline
  />
