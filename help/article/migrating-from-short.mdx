Short.io is a popular URL shortener that lets you create short links, which can be used in your marketing campaigns, social media posts, and more.

## How to migrate from Short.io to Dub.co

If you're looking to migrate from Short.io to Dub.co, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate your links in a few simple steps.

<Steps>

<Step title="Get your Short.io API key">

First, log into your Short.io account and navigate to the [Integrations & API](https://app.short.io/settings/integrations/api-key) page.

</Step>

<Step title="Use the Short.io migration tool">

If you haven't already, [create a workspace on Dub.co](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace#how-to-create-a-workspace).

<Info>
  **Protip**: Once you create your workspace, we generally recommend you **_not
  to [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain)_** until
  you've migrated all your links. This will prevent any potential downtime for
  your links.
</Info>

Then, from your workspace dashboard, click on the `⋮` button next to the **Create Link** button and select **Import from Short.io**.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

You'll be prompted to enter your Short.io API key. Paste the API key you copied in the previous step and click **Confirm API Key**.

Behind the scenes, we'll fetch all your Short.io custom domains and their respective number of links. You'll be presented with a list of domains that we've found.

</Step>

<Step title="Select the domains you want to migrate">

Select the domains you want to migrate and click **Confirm import**. In just a few seconds, all your links will be migrated to Dub.co.

Once all your links have been imported, we will send you an email to let you know that the migration is complete.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain">

Once you receive the email, you can [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) by setting the right DNS records. This will ensure that your links are pointing to Dub.co and not Short.io. Once you've done this, you can start using your links!
