Occasionally, `dub.sh` short links are blocked by web browsers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). When that happens, you might run into the following errors when you try to visit a `dub.sh` link:

## Error 1: "Your connection is not private" (Google Chrome)

Here's an example of a "Your connection is not private" warning in Google Chrome:

  alt="'Your connection is not private' warning"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

## Error 2: "This site has been reported as unsafe" (Microsoft Defender)

Here's another example of a "This site has been reported as unsafe" warning in Microsoft Defender:

  alt="Microsoft Defender's 'This site has been reported as unsafe' warning"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

## Error 3: "This site cannot provide a secure connection" (ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR)

And sometimes, certain Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will also block `dub.sh` links. This is what you might see when you try to visit a `dub.sh` link if it's blocked by your ISP:

  alt="'This site cannot provide a secure connection' error"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

## Why does this happen?

This is because `dub.sh` links are the default short link on Dub, and can sometimes be used by malicious actors to hide the true destination of a link – which can be a phishing site, or a site that downloads malware onto your computer.

As an unfortunate side effect, this means that sometimes, legitimate `dub.sh` links are also blocked by certain web browsers and ISPs, causing them not to work.

## Solution 1: Petition your ISP or browser antivirus software

One way to fix it is by sending a petition to your [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/6246513) or browser antivirus software to unblock the link. Here's an example verbiage you can use:

> Hi there,
>
> I would like to petition for the dub.sh domain to be unblocked. Dub (https://dub.co) is a link management platform (similar to Bitly) that I use to share links with my friends and family. It is not a malicious site.
>
> Occasionally, there might be malicious links that are created on Dub, but Dub has processes in place that actively monitors and removes these links. I have also personally reported malicious links to Dub, and they have been removed within 24 hours.
>
> If you do discover any malicious links, you can report them here: https://dub.co/legal/abuse
>
> Thank you!

This is the most effective way to unblock the link, but it can take some time for the request to be processed.

## Solution 2: Use a custom domain

Alternatively, you can also [use Dub with your custom domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain), instead of the default `dub.sh` domain.

This will ensure that your links are never blocked by web browsers, and also give your links a more professional, branded look. Custom domains are also more trustworthy and can lead to **30% higher click-through rates**.

We also launched [1-year free .link domains on all paid plans](https://dub.co/blog/introducing-free-domains) recently that you can use for your short links:
