</Tip>

Tolt is a go-to affiliate management platform for many early-stage companies.

However, Tolt is limiting for companies that want to run their affiliate programs at scale:

1. **Basic analytics**: While Tolt shows basic clicks and leads, it lacks UTM and referrer data. You see the numbers but not what drives them.
2. **Frequent payout failures**: Tolt offers automated payouts on higher-tier plans, but customers who migrated to Dub reported frequent payout failures. This means spending hours troubleshooting payments and managing frustrated partners.
3. **No affiliate network**: As standalone software, Tolt leaves the task of finding and recruiting high-quality affiliates entirely to you.
4. **Outdated UI:** Tolt’s UI feels outdated, despite the platform positioning itself for SaaS companies, where intuitive, modern dashboards are typically a priority.

**This is where [Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners) comes in.**

1. **Comprehensive analytics**: Dub offers [powerful real-time analytics](https://dub.co/analytics), including [conversion tracking](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions), device, browser, referrer, country, and more. Our [AI feature](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics#bonus-ask-ai-feature) makes filtering data intuitive and quick.
2. **Payouts you can rely on:** We let you [pay your partners globally](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-payouts) in 1-click, with tax compliance built-in, so you can have peace of mind knowing that all payouts are completed successfully.
3. **Powerful affiliate network**: With over 5,000 active affiliates in our network, Dub makes it easy to find and recruit high-performing partners with a proven track record of driving results.
4. **Advanced reward structures**: On Dub, you can choose between [3 reward types](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards#configuring-reward-types) – per click, per lead, and per sale (flat/percentage). You can also set different [reward conditions](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards#adding-reward-conditions) (e.g., a higher reward for customers based in the U.S. vs other countries) and create [bounties](https://dub.co/help/article/program-bounties) to provide additional rewards for your affiliates.

In this article, we'll learn how to import your Tolt affiliate program to[ Dub Partners](/help/article/dub-partners) for a more powerful, scalable, and branded partner management experience.

## How to migrate from Tolt to Dub?

If you're looking to migrate from Tolt to Dub Partners, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate everything over in just 2-3 clicks – without breaking any existing Tolt affiliate links.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a custom domain to your Dub workspace">
Before starting the migration process, you'll need to add a custom domain to Dub. This domain will be used to create short links for each affiliate link that we import from Tolt.

If you haven't added a custom domain to Dub yet, you can [follow this guide to set that up](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain).

</Step>

<Step title="Set up conversion tracking + client-side click-tracking">

Next, [set up conversion tracking](https://dub.co/docs/partners/quickstart) to track signup and sale events. We also have some [in-app guides that you can reference here](https://app.dub.co/guides).

For backward compatibility, we also recommend setting up [client-side click-tracking](https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) when installing the [client-side `@dub/analytics` SDK](https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side/introduction) on your site. This will ensure all your existing `domain.com?via=affiliate` links will keep working as expected, which gives affiliates time to update their links to the new format.

You can [follow our guide](https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) on how to set up client-side click-tracking for your Dub short links to set that up.

</Step>

<Step title="Get your Tolt API Key and Program ID">
[Follow this guide](https://docs.tolt.com/authentication) to get your Tolt API key – API keys can be created in the [Settings →  Integrations](https://app.tolt.io/settings?tab=integrations) tab of your Tolt dashboard:

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/tolt-api-key.png"
  alt="Tolt API key"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

You will also need to get your Tolt Program ID under [Program Settings](https://app.tolt.io/program-settings?page=general-settings):

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/tolt-program-id.png"
  alt="Tolt Program ID"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

We will use the API key and Program ID to retrieve and import your existing Tolt affiliate program to Dub.

</Step>

<Step title="Import your Tolt program in the Partners tab">

Once you've [set up your Dub partner program](https://dub.co/docs/partners/quickstart#step-3%3A-set-up-your-partner-program), go to your [Partners tab](https://app.dub.co/program/partners), click on the `⋮` button and select "Import from Tolt".

To save you some time, [here's a quicklink](https://app.dub.co/program/partners?import=tolt) that will get you directly to the Tolt import flow.

Then, add your Tolt API key + Program ID and select **Continue.**

</Step>

## What data is migrated?

Our Tolt migration tool imports the following attributes to Dub Partners:

### Affiliates / Partners

To ensure the efficiency of your partner program, we automatically filter out dormant affiliates and only import the ones that are both:

- In an "active" state ([docs](https://developers.rewardful.com/rest-api/affiliates/object#state))
- Have at least 1 lead / referral

We also automatically import all your affiliates' links and recreate them in Dub using your program's domain and default URL.

<Info>
Since Tolt doesn't expose a `/rewards` endpoint, your Tolt program terms will not be migrated – all partners will be assigned to your program's default reward.

Learn more about how [Partner rewards](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards) work on Dub.

</Info>

### Referrals / Customers

By default, we import all referrals that are associated with an affiliate in your Tolt program. This ensures that all subsequent subscription renewal events will continue to be tracked on Dub.

<Warning>
  Some referrals might not have a valid Stripe customer ID. Those referrals will
  still be imported, with the Stripe customer ID updated afterwards.
</Warning>

### Commissions

We also import all commissions associated with any customers that were imported above. Depending on the commission state on Tolt, they will be marked accordingly on Dub as well:
| Tolt | Dub |
| --- | --- |
| `Pending` | `Pending` |
| `Approved` | `Pending` |
| `Paid` | `Paid` |
| `Rejected` | `Canceled` |
| `Refunded` | `Refunded` |

Additionally, Dub also supports 3 additional commission states:

- `Fraud`: Useful for marking a sale as fraudulent and excluding it from any future payouts.
- `Processed`: When a commission has been added to a [payout](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-payouts) (after any applicable holding period).
- `Duplicate`: Useful for marketing if a commission was rewarded more than once and needs to be marked as a duplicate event.

<Warning>
  Commissions for a referral that do not have a valid Stripe customer ID or a
  transaction trace will not be imported.
</Warning>

If there are any other attributes that you'd like to see migrated (or if you would like to customize any of the rules above), please [send us an email](mailto:support@dub.co?subject=Rewardful%20migration%20feedback) to let us know!

## Next steps

After importing your program, here are some recommended next steps:

### 1. Set up your bank account for partner payouts

Dub Partners supports [1-click payouts](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-payouts) to partners all across the globe.

  style={{ border: "none", width: "100%", height: "420px" }}
  title="Supported payout countries"

We generally recommend using ACH for partner payouts as it is the most cost-effective option. Here's [how you can set up your bank account](/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account) for ACH payouts.

### 2. Notify your affiliates about the platform change
