As an affiliate partner on Dub, you can participate in various affiliate programs and receive commission payouts directly into your bank account.

In this article, we'll explore how commissions and payouts work on Dub, their various statuses, and when you can expect to be paid by the programs you work with.

## Commission statuses

When you receive a commission on Dub, it goes through the following statuses:
- `Pending`: This is the initial status for a commission. Depending on your program's [holding period](#what-does-holding-period-mean), commissions can stay in "pending" status anywhere from less than a day to 90 days.
- `Processed`: When a commission has been added to a payout (after any applicable [holding period](#what-does-holding-period-mean)), its status will change from "pending" to "processed".
- `Paid`: When the payout containing the commission has been paid by the program, the commission will be updated to "paid" status.

Occasionally, commissions can also be updated to the following statuses:
- `Refunded`: If the sale for the commission was refunded. This is usually automatically detected via our [Stripe integration](https://dub.co/integrations/stripe), or manually by the program.
- `Fraud`: If a sale was marked as fraudulent by your program.
- `Canceled`: If a sale was marked as canceled/voided by your program (e.g. in cases of self-referrals where commissions are not eligible for payout).
- `Duplicate`: If a sale was marked as duplicate by your program.

In these cases, we recommend reaching out to your program's support email with any questions/appeals that you might have.

## Payout statuses

Payouts on Dub go through the following statuses:

- `Pending`: When you start earning commissions from a program, they'll be accrued under a payout entry. If the program has a	[minimum payout amount](#what-does-minimum-payout-amount-mean) set, your payout amount will need to reach the threshold to become eligible for payment.
- `Processing`: When a program initiates a payout to you, the payout will be updated to a "processing" state until the payment settles on Dub. This process can take up to 5 business days.
- `Processed`: Once the program's payout has settled on Dub, the payout will be updated to a "processed" state. If the payout amount is above your [minimum withdrawal balance](/help/article/receiving-payouts#what-is-the-minimum-withdrawal-amount-and-how-does-it-work), the funds will be automatically paid out to your connected bank account.
- `Sent`: When your payout is on its way to your connected bank account, it will be updated to a "sent" state. Depending on your bank location, this can take anywhere from 1 to 14 business days (you will see the estimated arrival date in the notification email from Dub).
- `Completed`: When the payout is completed and the funds are deposited into your bank account.

## Frequently asked questions

### What does "holding period" mean?

Programs can set certain **holding periods** for earned commissions, during which your commissions will be kept in `pending` status and won't be eligible for payout:
- 0 days
- 14 days
- 30 days (most common)
- 60 days
- 90 days

This is usually done for security / fraud prevention purposes, as well as to account for potential refunds/chargebacks from referred customers.

### What does "minimum payout amount" mean?

Programs can also set a **minimum payout amount** (e.g. $100), where commissions will be accrued and only eligible for payout after it surpasses the minimum threshold.

The default payout amount on Dub is $0.

### When will I get paid?

This depends on your program's payment schedule, which is usually at the beginning or the end of the month. We recommend reaching out to your program's support team to confirm the exact payment date.
