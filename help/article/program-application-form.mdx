## What is the program application form?

The program application form collects the information you want from people applying to [your program](/help/article/dub-partners). Use it to ask about websites, social accounts, experience, audience size, or any details that help you decide who to accept.

<Tip>
  On Dub, you can create a custom application form for each [partner
  group](/help/article/partner-groups) in your program. This is helpful for
  collecting different information from different partner types – e.g.
  influencers vs affiliates vs resellers.

By default, when you create a new partner group, it reuses the application
form details from your default partner group, but you can always edit them
afterwards.

</Tip>

## Where to find the application form builder?

From your **Groups** page, open the [partner group](/help/article/partner-groups) you want to tailor the application form for.

From the tab navigation, click **Branding,** then in the content panel, choose **Application form** to open the editor.

For your convenience, [here's a quick link](https://app.dub.co/program/groups/default/branding?tab=application) that brings you directly to the application form builder for your program's default group.

## Mandatory fields

Name, email, and country are always required and appear at the top of every form. You cannot remove or rename them.

## Editing and adding fields

Hover over form content in the builder to reveal actions for adding, editing, deleting, and reordering fields. Content that appears above the form can only be edited. This keeps the page layout consistent for applicants.

The multiple-choice input can serve multiple purposes:

2. **Checkbox** - A list of items that an applicant can select one or many from

By default, the initial input is set to the radio option, but the input can adapt to your needs.
