You can archive your custom domains on Dub to better manage your domains.

When you archive a domain:

- The domain will not show up in the [link builder](/help/article/dub-link-builder)
- The domain will also be hidden from the **Active** domain list
- Their links will continue to work and will still show up on the links dashboard

/>

To archive a domain, you can follow the steps below:

1. Go to your workspace settings and click on the **Domains** tab.
2. Click on the `⋮` button next to the domain you want to archive, and select **Archive**.
3. In the modal that appears, select **Confirm archive** to archive the domain.

The domain will now be archived and will no longer show up in the active domain list.
