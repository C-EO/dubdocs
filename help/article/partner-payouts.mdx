If you're running a partner program with hundreds of partners, you can avoid manually sending each payout or [having to worry about payout failures](https://dub.co/blog/dub-vs-rewardful#partner-payouts). Dub lets you pay partners in one click, with tax compliance built in.

## Supported payout countries

Here's the full list of countries we support:

<SupportedCountries />

## Tax compliance

Dub Partners automatically handles tax compliance for your US-based partners by collecting [W-9 forms](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/what-is-a-w-9-form) and sending out [1099-NEC forms](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-nec-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces) to individuals or entities that received $600 or more in payments for a given fiscal year.

For non-US partners, Dub collects [W-8 forms](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/what-is-a-w-8-form) to confirm they are not a US resident for tax purposes.

## Payouts dashboard

| Status     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pending    | Payouts that have not been processed yet, which can either be currently due or remain in pending status (in cases where the partner has not [configured their payout method](/help/article/receiving-payouts), or the payout has not yet reached the [minimum payout amount](#minimum-payout-amount)). |
| Processing | Payouts that have been [confirmed](#how-to-pay-your-partners) – depending on your [payout method](#payout-fees-and-timing), this step can take up to 4 business days.                                                                                                                                  |
| Sent       | When the funds have been sent to the partner's connected bank account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Completed  | When the payout has been fully paid out to the partner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Failed     | This is an edge case that happens with PayPal payouts, where the partner's PayPal is not set up to receive payouts. No action is required from your end in these cases – the partner will need to sort out their PayPal account and retry the payout from their end.                                   |
| Canceled   | For payouts that have been canceled – usually when a partner is banned from the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Payout holding period

On Dub, you can also set a "payout holding period" to specify how long your commissions will be held in "pending" status before becoming eligible for payout.

This is useful for safeguarding against potential refunds, chargebacks, or fraudulent transactions.

<Info>
  If you're using our [Stripe integration](/docs/conversions/sales/stripe), any
  refunds that happen on Stripe will be automatically detected by Dub and the
  [corresponding commission will also be marked as
  refunded](/help/article/partner-commissions#commission-statuses).
</Info>

To set a payout holding period for your program, go to your [individual groups](/help/article/partner-groups) and click on the **Settings** tab. Here you'll find the payout holding period settings in the "Addtional settings" group.

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="Program payout settings"
  />
</Frame>

Your options include the following:

- 0 days (default)
- 7 days
- 14 days
- 30 days
- 60 days
- 90 days

When you update the payout holding period, you can apply the new setting to every group at once. Just select the box labelled `Apply to all groups` before confirming. The change will take effect right away.

## Minimum payout amount

You can also set an optional "minimum payout amount" (e.g. $100). When this is set, partners with earnings below the minimum payout amount won't be eligible for payout until they reach the specific threshold set.

Click the button in the top right to show the **Payout settings**. Unlike the payout holding period, this setting is program-wide.

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="Payout settings button"

Your options include the following:

- $0 (default)
- $10
- $20
- $50
- $100

## How to pay your partners

When one or more of your partners have earned more than the minimum payout amount, click **Confirm payouts** from the [summary header](/help/article/partner-payouts#summary-header) to open the payout details.

- **Payout method:** Choose your payout method based on the accounts you’ve connected. Click the gear icon to manage [connected payment methods](https://app.dub.co/settings/billing).
- **Cutoff Period:** If set, only commissions earned on or before this date will be paid. Useful for reconciliation payouts for a specific fiscal period (e.g. last month, last quarter) without including newer commissions.

If everything looks right, click **Confirm payout** to trigger a new payout to your partners.

## Payout fees and timing

On Dub, you can send payouts using various payment methods such as ACH, credit card, and more. Depending on your Dub plan and the payment method you choose, your payout fees and timing will vary:

| Payment method                                                       | Fee                                                                                                 | Timing                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [ACH](/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account)                      | [Business / Advanced](https://dub.co/pricing): 5% <br/> [Enterprise](https://dub.co/enterprise): 3% | Up to 4 business days |
| Credit card / [Link](https://link.com/) <br/> Apple Pay / Google Pay | [Business / Advanced](https://dub.co/pricing): 8% <br/> [Enterprise](https://dub.co/enterprise): 6% | Instant               |

For larger payouts, we recommend using ACH as it is the most cost-effective option. Here's [how you can set up your bank account](/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account) for ACH payouts.
