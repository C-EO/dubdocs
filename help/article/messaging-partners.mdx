</Tip>

On Dub, you can use the Messaging Center to communicate directly with the partners in your program. Partners get notified via email and can respond to your messages in real-time.

## Messages overview

The messaging center has three panels:

| Panel        | Content                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Inbox        | All your conversations in one place.            |
| Conversation | The full thread with your selected partner.     |
| Details      | Key info and performance stats for the partner. |

### Inbox panel

Your Inbox lists every conversation with your partners. Select one to pick up where you left off, or click the **Pencil** button in the top right to compose something new.

Each conversation row shows:

- **Unread indicator** – shows if you’ve read the message
- **Partner** – partner’s name and profile image
- **Last activity** – most recent message from you or the partner
- **Excerpt** – short preview of the latest message

### Conversation panel

In the Conversation panel, you’ll see the full thread with your partner. Workspace members can reply too, with their profile images shown beside each message.

### Message status

Each message sent has a check mark next to the send time:

- **Single check mark** – delivered

- **Double check marks** – delivered and read
  (either in email or in the app)

### Details panel

The details panel is collapsible and shows partner information and performance stats. You can also change their program group here.

## Disabling messaging

If you prefer to handle support outside Dub, you can disable partner messaging.

To disable messaging, head to your program **Resources** and in the **Help and Support** section, click the switch to off to disable partner messaging.

When messaging is disabled, partners who try to message you will see your support email address instead:
