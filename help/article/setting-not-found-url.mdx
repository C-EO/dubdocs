By default, when a user visits a short link that doesn't exist on Dub, they will see a placeholder "Link Not Found" page:

  alt="Placeholder 404 page on Dub"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

If you are [using a custom domain on Dub](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain), you can set a custom URL to redirect users to when a short link under your domain is not found.

To set a custom not found URL for your domains, you can follow the steps below:

1. Go to your [workspace Domains settings tab](https://app.dub.co/domains).
2. Click on the `⋮` button next to the domain you want to set a custom not found URL for.
3. Select **Edit Domain** to edit the domain settings.
4. Toggle the **Not Found URL** section to enable it, and enter the custom URL to redirect users to when a short link under your domain is not found.
5. Click on the **Save changes** button to save the changes.
