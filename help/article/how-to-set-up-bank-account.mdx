<Tip>
  This feature is only available on [Business plans and
  above](https://dub.co/pricing/partners).
</Tip>

With [Dub Partners](/help/article/dub-partners), you can [send payouts](/help/article/partner-payouts) to your affiliates using your credit card on file. However, for larger payouts, it might be more cost-efficient to set up your bank account for direct debit instead.

Depending on your bank's country, we support 3 different types of direct debit methods:

- **US**: Automated Clearing House (ACH)
- **Canada**: Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS)
- **Europe**: Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)

<Info>
  Due to the fraud/dispute risks involved with SEPA direct debit, it is
  currently only available on [Enterprise](https://dub.co/enterprise) plans.

## Connecting your bank account to Dub

Here's how you can connect your bank account to Dub for partner payouts:

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a new direct debit method">

On your [workspace's billing tab](https://app.dub.co/settings/billing), scroll down to **Payment methods** section.

Click on the **Connect** button to add a new direct debit method:

Select the correct method based on your bank's location, and you'll be redirected to the Stripe connection flow.

If you selected SEPA direct debit in the previous step, you will need to manually enter your IBAN number and account details to set it up instead:

</Step>

<Step title="Manually verify bank account" optional>

Alternatively, you can also manually verify your bank account via the [micro-deposits verification method](https://stripe.com/ie/resources/more/what-is-micro-deposit-verification-here-is-how-it-works).

To do that, select the **Enter bank details manually** option:

</Frame>

Then, enter your bank details (routing number, account number):

<Frame>
  <img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/enter-bank-details-modal.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

You'll receive a micro deposit in your account within 1-2 business days that will include a six-character descriptor code starting with `SM`:

```
SMXXXX
```

Once you receive the micro-deposit, [reach out to support](mailto:support@dub.co?subject=Dub%20Bank%20Account%20Micro-deposit%20Verification%20Code&body=Hi%20there!%20Here's%20my%20micro-deposit%20verification%20code%3A%20SMXXXX%0A) with the code and we'll help you verify your bank account.

</Step>

</Steps>

## My bank account is currently unavailable

Depending on which bank you select, Stripe might show an error that the bank is currently unavailable:
