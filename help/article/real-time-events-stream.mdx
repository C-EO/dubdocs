<Tip>
  This feature is only available on [Dub's Business
  plan](https://dub.co/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

On any given day, we track upwards of **1,000,000 click events** at Dub.

These events are ingested into our data warehouse, which is then materialized in a comprehensive, [real-time analytics dashboard](/help/article/dub-analytics) that gives you powerful insights into your user base.

While this is great, it is still an aggregated view of your data. What if you want to see a chronological stream of click events and export them for further analysis?

**This is where Dub's Real-time Events Stream feature comes in.**

Dub's Real-time Events Stream is a detailed, real-time stream of events across your entire Dub workspace.

## Where can I access it?

The real-time events stream lives in your workspace's [**Events** tab](https://app.dub.co/events), but you can also access it via the **View Events** button in the Analytics tab:

</Frame>

<Tip>
  When you click on the **View Events** button, the same filters you have
  applied in the Analytics tab are applied to the Events tab as well.
</Tip>

The events stream is real-time by default – meaning every click event that is recorded will show up in your Events tab in real-time.

## Customizing your events table

You can also customize the dashboard to only show the columns you are interested in:

Here are the columns you can choose from:

- **Link**: The link that was clicked/scanned
- **Country**: The country that the event originated from
- **City**: The city that the event originated from
- **Continent**: The continent that the event originated from
- **Device**: The device that was used to trigger the event
- **Browser**: The browser that was used to trigger the event
- **OS**: The operating system that was used to trigger the event
- **Referrer**: The referrer information for the event
- **IP Address**: The IP address that the event originated from (non-EU only)

## Filtering and exporting events

You can also filter the events by the [same filter options as the analytics dashboard](/help/article/dub-analytics#filtering-data).

There are two ways you can filter the events stream:

1. By clicking on the **Filter** button in the top right of the dashboard.
2. Clicking on the filter icon that appears when you hover over a given column value.

Once you've filtered the events to your liking, you can export them by clicking `⋮` button and selecting **Download as CSV**.
