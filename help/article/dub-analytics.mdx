On any given day, Dub Analytics tracks upwards of **10 million clicks and [conversion events](/help/article/dub-conversions)**.

With the sheer volume of data that's tracked, it is important to be able to easily filter and create reports to help marketing teams make informed decisions.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to use Dub Analytics to get the most out of your click events and engagement data.

## Live Demo

To give you some context before we dive in, here's a live demo of Dub's Analytics dashboard:

  create your own shareable link by following the steps in the [Share your
  analytics](/help/article/share-analytics) guide.

## Analytics Views

Dub's Analytics dashboard consists of several views:

1. [Time-series analytics chart](#1-time-series-analytics-chart)
2. [Aggregated data for different facets (top views)](#2-aggregated-data-for-different-facets-top-views)
3. [Real-time events stream](#3-real-time-events-stream)

### 1. Time-series analytics chart

This is the default view and shows you the number of click events over time.

  alt="Time-series line chart"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

### 2. Aggregated data for different facets (top views)

These are more commonly known as the "Top Views" in Dub Analytics. These views show you the top links, countries, cities, devices, and more.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

### 3. Real-time events stream

Dub also offers a [Real-time Events Stream](/help/article/real-time-events-stream) view that shows you the events that are happening in real-time. These events are sorted by the time they occurred, so you can see the most recent events first.

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/events-stream-dashboard-01.png"
  alt="The Events Stream dashboard on Dub"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

The real-time events stream lives in your workspace's [**Events** tab](https://app.dub.co/events), but you can also access it via the **View Events** button in the Analytics tab:

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/events-view-button-01.png"
  alt="Quick link to open-up the events stream from the Analytics tab"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

<Tip>
  When you click on the **View Events** button, the same filters you have
  applied in the Analytics tab are applied to the Events tab as well.
</Tip>

## Date Range Picker

Dub Analytics comes with a powerful date range picker that allows you to select custom date ranges for your reports.

This is especially useful when you want to compare data over different time periods, or when you want to focus on a specific time frame that is not covered by the preset date ranges.

<img

  alt="New Date Range Picker for custom date ranges"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

<Tip>

Pro-tip: You can use keyboard shortcuts to toggle between different preset date ranges:

- `D` – Last 24 hours
- `W` – Last 7 days
- `T` – Last 30 days
- `3` – Last 3 months
- `L` – Last 12 months
- `M` – Month to Date
- `Q` – Quarter to Date
- `Y` – Year to date
- `A` – All time

</Tip>

## Filtering data

Dub's analytics dashboard comes with a sleek and keyboard-friendly filter bar at the top of the dashboard that you can use to filter your data.

## Advanced analytics filters

You can also use our built-in advanced filtering capabilities to create powerful, customized reports for your marketing campaigns:

### Multi-filtering ("IS ONE OF")

If you need to pull stats for multiple entities at once, you can now do so with our multi-filtering feature:

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/advanced-filters-is.png"
  alt="Advanced filters IS"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

Examples:

- Filtering by multiple [partners](/help/article/managing-program-partners)
- Filtering by multiple [partner groups](/help/article/partner-groups)
- Filtering by multiple [folders](/help/article/filter-analytics-by-folders)
- Filtering by multiple [tags](/help/article/filter-analytics-by-tags)

### Negative filtering ("IS NOT")

Additionally, you can also pull stats for all entities \*\*\*except\*\*\* a select few to make more reporting more robust.

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/advanced-filters-is-not.png"
  alt="Advanced filters IS NOT"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

Examples:

- Filtering for non-US traffic
- Filtering for all [partners](/help/article/managing-program-partners) except a few outliers
- Filtering for all [partner groups](/help/article/partner-groups) except for "User referrals"
- Filtering for all [tags](/help/article/filter-analytics-by-tags) except for "General links"

Best part? You can also mix and match both multi-filtering and negative-filtering as well:

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/advanced-analytics-filters.jpg"
  alt="Mix and match analytics filters"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

This is available for both [Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners) & [Dub Links](https://dub.co/links), and you can filter across [all of the facets mentioned above](#filtering-data).

Check out [an example here](https://app.dub.co/share/dash_6NSA6vNm017MZwfzt8SubNSZ?interval=30d&country=-IN%2CVN).

## Exporting your analytics data

You can also [export your analytics data](/help/article/how-to-export-analytics) or [events stream data](/help/article/real-time-events-stream#filtering-and-exporting-events) to a CSV file at any time. This can be useful if you want to analyze the data in a business intelligence (BI) tool, share it with your team, or import it into a spreadsheet.

<img
  src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/download-csv-button-01.png"
  alt="Click on the download icon to export the data"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

## Bonus: "Ask AI" feature

You can also use the "Ask AI" feature to query your analytics with natural language.

For example, you can ask questions like:

- "mobile chrome users US only"
- "QR scans last quarter"
- "UK android users"
- "[filter for new sales only](https://dub.co/changelog/filter-sale-type) last 30 days"

And [Dub AI](https://dub.co/blog/introducing-dub-ai) will automatically select the right filters and generate a report for you.
