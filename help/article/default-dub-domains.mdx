Dub is the only link management platform that provides [default branded domains](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains/default) for you to use. These domains are automatically set up for you when you create a new account on Dub.

## List of default branded domains

Dub offers the following default branded domains:

1. `dub.sh`: This domain is the default domain for all new Dub accounts. You can use this domain to shorten any link you want to share.
2. `spti.fi`: Branded domain for Spotify links (songs, playlists, etc.).
3. `git.new`: Branded domain for GitHub links (repositories, gists, etc.).
4. `ggl.link`: Branded domain for Google links (search, docs, sheets, slides, drive, maps, etc.).
5. `chatg.pt`: Branded domain for ChatGPT links (convos, custom GPTs).
6. `amzn.id`: Branded domain for Amazon links (products, wishlists, etc.).

You can use these domains to shorten links related to the respective platforms. For example, if you want to share a Spotify link, you can use the `spti.fi` domain to shorten it.

## Premium dub.link domain

Dub also offers a premium `dub.link` domain for [Pro users](https://dub.co/pricing) and above. Since it's only available on our paid plans, it's much more exclusive than our free [dub.sh](https://dub.sh) short domain.

## Dub.sh links vs custom domain links

Once you create a workspace on Dub, you have the option to choose between the default `dub.sh` domain or [your own custom domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) to create short links.

Here are the difference between the two options:

|                | Default `dub.sh` links                                            | Custom domain links                                                                                                             |

| **Branding**   | Dub branding on the short link                                    | Your own branding on the short link                                                                                             |
