</Tip>

PartnerStack is a go-to affiliate management platform for many businesses worldwide.

While widely used, PartnerStack has its limitations that are especially noticeable if you are just starting your affiliate program:

1. **Pricing**: Companies must contact sales for a quote, with the average customer paying [$18,000](https://www.vendr.com/marketplace/partnerstack) annually, plus a ‘take fee’ on affiliate payouts that can be [as high as 15%](http://d.to/partnerstack-fees). These costly annual contracts lock you in before your affiliate program has a chance to scale.
2. **Complex UI**: PartnerStack has every feature you can think of, resulting in dense navigation, buried settings, and workflows that require documentation to understand.
3. **Affiliate network**: PartnerStack has one of the largest affiliate networks with 65,000+ users. But customer feedback consistently shows that most of these ‘partners’ generate no results. You have to manually go through thousands of profiles to find the few who actually drive revenue.

**This is where [Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners) comes in.**

1. **Pricing that scales with your success**: You can start your affiliate program on Dub with [as little as $90/month](https://dub.co/pricing/partners) and only 5% payout fees. As you grow, payout fees drop to 3%, giving you the flexibility to reward partners without high costs eating into your margins.
2. **Modern UI with enterprise-grade capabilities**: Dub's modern interface makes it simple for both you and your partners to navigate without a learning curve. You can use our [Embedded Referral Dashboard](/docs/partners/embedded-referrals) to create a seamless referral experience, or leverage our best-in-class [Fraud Detection](/help/article/fraud-detection) suite to ensure the safety/compliance of your program. The possibilities are endless.
3. **Powerful affiliate network**: With over 5,000 meticulously vetted affiliates in our partner network, Dub makes it easy to find and recruit high-performing partners with a proven track record of driving results.

In this article, we'll learn how to import your PartnerStack affiliate program to[ Dub Partners](/help/article/dub-partners) for a more powerful, scalable, and branded partner management experience.

## How to migrate from PartnerStack to Dub?

If you're looking to migrate from PartnerStack to Dub Partners, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate everything over in just 2-3 clicks – without breaking any existing PartnerStack affiliate links.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a custom domain to your Dub workspace">
Before starting the migration process, you'll need to add a custom domain to Dub. This domain will be used to create short links for each affiliate link that we import from PartnerStack.

If you haven't added a custom domain to Dub yet, you can [follow this guide to set that up](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain).

</Step>

<Step title="Set up conversion tracking">

Next, [set up conversion tracking](/docs/quickstart/server) to track signup and sale events. We also have some [in-app guides that you can reference here](https://app.dub.co/guides).

</Step>

<Step title="Get your PartnerStack API Keys">

[Follow this guide](https://docs.tolt.com/authentication) to get your PartnerStack API keys – API keys can be created in the [Settings → API](https://app.partnerstack.com/settings/integrations) tab of your PartnerStack dashboard:

    alt="PartnerStack API key"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Make sure to use your production API keys to import live partners only (since
  test partners won't be imported).
</Tip>

We will use the generated Public and Secret keys to retrieve and import your existing PartnerStack program to Dub.

</Step>

<Step title="Import your PartnerStack program in the Partners tab">

Once you've [set up your Dub partner program](/help/article/setting-up-your-program), go to your [Partners tab](https://app.dub.co/program/partners), click on the `⋮` button and select "Import from PartnerStack".

To save you some time, [here's a quicklink](https://app.dub.co/program/partners?import=partnerstack) that will get you directly to the PartnerStack import flow.

## What data is migrated?

Our PartnerStack migration tool imports the following attributes to Dub Partners:

### Affiliates / Partners

To ensure the efficiency of your partner program, we automatically filter out dormant affiliates and only import the ones that are both:

- In an "active" state ([docs](https://developers.rewardful.com/rest-api/affiliates/object#state))
- Have at least 1 lead / referral

We also automatically import all your affiliates' links and recreate them in Dub using your program's domain and default URL.

<Info>
Since PartnerStack doesn't expose a `/triggers` endpoint, your PartnerStack triggers will not be migrated – all partners will be assigned to your program's default reward.

Learn more about how [Partner rewards](/help/article/partner-rewards) work on Dub.

Feel free to [reach out to support](https://dub.co/contact/support) if you need help manually configuring specific reward groups for your importer partners.

</Info>

### Referrals / Customers

By default, we import all referrals that are associated with an affiliate in your PartnerStack campaign. This ensures that all subsequent subscription renewal events will continue to be tracked on Dub.

Certain customers will not be imported, such as test accounts or any customer that is not associated with an affiliate link.

<Warning>
  Some referrals might not have a valid Stripe customer ID. Those referrals will
  still be imported, with the Stripe customer ID updated afterwards.
</Warning>

### Commissions

We also import all commissions associated with any customers that were imported above. Depending on the commission state on PartnerStack, they will be marked accordingly on Dub as well:
| PartnerStack | Dub |
| --- | --- |
| `Pending` | `Pending` |
| `Approved` | `Processed` |
| `Paid` | `Paid` |
| `Declined` | `Canceled` |
| `Hold` | `Fraud` |

Additionally, Dub also supports 2 additional commission states:

- `Refunded`: When the sale for the commission was refunded. With our [Stripe integration](/docs/integrations/stripe), this is automatically detected and updated.
- `Duplicate`: Useful for marketing if a commission was rewarded more than once and needs to be marked as a duplicate event.

<Warning>
  Commissions for a referral that do not have a valid Stripe customer ID or a
  transaction trace will not be imported.
</Warning>

If there are any other attributes that you'd like to see migrated (or if you would like to customize any of the rules above), please [send us an email](mailto:support@dub.co?subject=Rewardful%20migration%20feedback) to let us know!

## Next steps

After importing your campaign, here are some recommended next steps:

### 1. Set up your bank account for partner payouts

Dub Partners supports [1-click payouts](/help/article/partner-payouts) to partners all across the globe.

<SupportedCountries />

We generally recommend using ACH for partner payouts as it is the most cost-effective option. Here's [how you can set up your bank account](/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account) for ACH payouts.
