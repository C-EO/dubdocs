On Dub, a "Workspace" is a space that you can use to store all the short links for your website, app, or business.

You can think of a Dub workspace as a "Team" or an "Organization" where you can [invite your teammates](/help/article/how-to-invite-teammates) to join and manage the links together.

## How to create a workspace

To create a workspace, go to the [Dub Dashboard](https://app.dub.co).

Here are the fields in the workspace creation modal:

1. **Workspace Name**: This is the name of your workspace on Dub.
2. **Workspace Slug**: This is your workspace's unique slug on Dub.

Once you have filled in the fields, click on the **Create workspace** button to create your workspace.

## Onboarding checklist

After you have created your workspace, you will be redirected to the workspace dashboard. Here, you will see a checklist of things that you can do to get started with your workspace.

1. **Configure your custom domain**: You can [configure your custom domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) to use your own domain for your short links.
2. **Create or import your links**: You can [create links](/help/article/how-to-create-link) or [import existing ones](/help/article/how-to-import-csv) to your workspace.
3. **Invite your teammates**: You can [invite your teammates](/help/article/how-to-invite-teammates) to join your workspace and manage the links together.

## How many domains can I add to a workspace?

Dub is the only link management platform that allows you to [add custom domains](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) for free. The number of domains that you can add to a workspace depends on your plan:

- **Free plan**: 3 domains
- **Pro plan**: 10 domains
- **Business plan**: 100 domains
- **Advanced plan**: 250 domains
- **Enterprise plan**: Unlimited domains

If your workspace has multiple domains, you will be able to filter the links in the workspace by their respective domains.

## Limits and Billing for Workspaces

On Dub, you can create as many workspaces as you want, and each workspace will be billed separately.

However, to prevent abuse, you can only create up to 2 workspaces on the Free plan. If you need more workspaces, you can [upgrade to the Pro plan](https://dub.co/pricing).
