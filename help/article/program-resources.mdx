Set partners up for success by providing support, clear docs, program terms, and brand assets in the dashboard so they can launch faster, avoid mistakes, and represent your brand consistently to drive better performance.

## Where to find your program resources

When viewing your Partner Program navigation, click on the **Resources** page under the **Engagement** group.

### Support Email

Your program's support email will be added to all email communications with your partners, and it will also be added to the program support resources section on the partner dashboard sidebar:

### Messaging center

<Tip>
  This feature is only available for [Advanced plans and
  above](https://dub.co/pricing/partners).
</Tip>

Enabling this allows you to directly [message your partners](/help/article/messaging-partners) in the Dub platform. This also allows partners to message you as well.

### Help Center

### Terms of Service

When configured, this will be added to your [program application form](/help/article/program-application-form) as a mandatory checkbox that partners have to accept before submitting their application:
