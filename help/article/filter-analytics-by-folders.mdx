<Tip>
  This feature is only available on [Pro plans and
  above](https://dub.co/pricing).
</Tip>

On Dub, you can filter analytics by [folders](/help/article/link-folders). This allows you to create powerful campaign-specific reports for your links.

For example, you're using folders to group your affiliate links and SMS marketing links, and want to see how each of those campaigns are performing.

You can filter the analytics by each of those folders and get a real-time dashboard of their clicks and [conversion analytics](/help/article/dub-conversions).

Before you can filter analytics by folders, you need to [create a folder](/help/article/link-folders#creating-a-folder) and [add links to it](/help/article/link-folders#adding-links-to-a-folder).

Then, as your links start accruing clicks, you will be able to filter your analytics by folders.

<Steps>

     <Step title="Open Analytics filter dropdown">
        In the [Analytics tab](https://app.dub.co/analytics) of your Dub workspace, click on the **Filter** button to open the filter dropdown:

            alt="Analytics filter dropdown folder"
          />
        </Frame>

        <Tip>
          You can also use the `F` keyboard shortcut to quickly open the filter dropdown.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select the 'Folder' filter option">
        Select the **Folder** option in the dropdown to open the folder filter:

</Frame>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Click on the folder you want to filter by">
        Finally, click on the folder you want to filter by:

        <Frame>
          <img
            src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/filtered-analytics-by-folder.png"
            alt="Filtered analytics by folder"
          />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Viewing filtered analytics for a folder directly

Alternatively, you can also view the filtered analytics for a folder directly, simply by opening the `⋮` dropdown next to the folder in your links dashboard and select the "Analytics" option:
