## When I delete my account, do you remove all my data?

Yes, when you delete your Dub account, all of your data will be permanently removed from our systems. This includes your Dub workspace, all of your data within the workspace, and any other data that is associated with your account.

Your email address will also be removed from our mailing list, and you will no longer receive any emails from Dub.
