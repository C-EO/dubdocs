<Info>
  This guide is for transferring custom domains between Dub workspaces. If you
  want to transfer [default Dub domains](/help/article/default-dub-domains)
  between workspaces, please refer to the guide on [how to transfer links
  between workspaces](/help/article/how-to-transfer-links).
</Info>

Transferring domains between workspaces is a common use case for many Dub users. Some examples:

- You're working with a client on a project and want to transfer the custom domains you've set up for them to their workspace
- You're [selling your custom link shortener](https://dub.co/customers/pallyy) and want to transfer the custom domain to the new owner's workspace

This guide will show you how to transfer your Dub custom domains from one workspace to another – in just a few clicks!

<Warning>
  When transferring a custom domain between workspaces, all links associated
  with the domain will also be transferred as well.

Transferring a domain will also fully reset the stats for the domain and its
associated links and is irreversible – proceed with caution.

</Warning>

## Step 1: Open the domain transfer modal

For a given domain, click on the `⋮` button and select **Transfer**.

</Frame>

Click on **Confirm transfer** to complete the transfer.

That's it! Your domain and its associated links should now be successfully transferred to the new workspace.

<Warning>
  Transferring a domain will also fully reset the stats for the domain and its
  associated links and is irreversible – proceed with caution.
</Warning>

## Caveats

- Transferring a domain will also **fully reset the stats** for the domain and its associated links and is irreversible – please proceed with caution.
- You cannot transfer a [primary domain](/help/article/how-to-set-primary-domain) to another workspace. You'll need to set another domain as primary before transferring the existing primary domain.
- Link tags are not transferred when you transfer a domain and its links between workspaces. You'll need to re-apply the tags to the link in the new workspace.
- You can only transfer links to workspaces that you have access to. If you don't have access to the destination workspace, you won't be able to transfer the domain.
