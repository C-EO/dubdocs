## Partner table

The partner table gives you a complete view of everyone in your program. By default, partners are sorted by **net revenue**, starting with your highest performers. This makes it easy to see who is driving the most value at a glance.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/partners-table-view.png"
    alt="Partners table"
  />
</Frame>

You can sort the table by any column header. For example, select **Conversions** to sort partners by the number of conversions instead of revenue.

### Default columns

When you first open the table, you will see a focused set of columns designed to give you a quick read on partner performance.

| Column      | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group       | The group this partner is in                              |
| Location    | The partner's declared location                           |
| Clicks      | Total number of clicks on the partner's links             |
| Leads       | Total number of leads generated by the partner's links    |
| Conversions | Total number of leads that converted to paying customers  |
| Revenue     | Total revenue generated by the partner's links            |
| Commissions | Total commissions paid to the partner for their referrals |
| Net Revenue | Net revenue after commissions                             |

<Frame>

    alt="Partners table"
  />
</Frame>

These can be changed anytime by clicking the `Gear icon` in the top right of the table, allowing you to enable or disable additional columns.

### Additional columns

If you need a deeper view, you can turn on extra performance and attribution metrics. These optional columns help you understand partner quality, funnel efficiency, and long term value more clearly.

| Column        | Description                                           | Equation                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| EPC           | Earnings Per Click                                    | Total Revenue ÷ Total Clicks      |
| Avg LTV       | Average lifetime value for each paying customer       | Total Revenue ÷ Total Conversions |
| Click -> Lead | Percentage of clicks that become leads                | Total Leads ÷ Total Clicks        |
| Click -> Conv | Percentage of clicks that convert to paying customers | Total Conversions ÷ Total Clicks  |
| Lead -> Conv  | Percentage of leads that convert to paying customers  | Total Conversions ÷ Total Leads   |
| ROAS          | Return On Ad Spend                                    | Total Revenue ÷ Total Commissions |

### Filter and search

Use filters to sort partners by group, status, or location. Filters help you spot top-performing partners.

You can also use the search field to search by name, email, or link. This is helpful when looking for a specific partner.

### Tenant ID

If you need to update the partner's tenant ID, changing the ID here will update the [tenantId for all their links](https://dub.co/docs/concepts/links/organization#tenant-id) as well. This could potentially impact any custom integration you have set up, so only change if you’re certain the information is correct and necessary.

### Customer data sharing

Enabling this setting allows this partner to see customer data on any leads or sales the partner has made.

Instead of the hidden email addresses, they will see the full customer email address and their name. They'll also be able to click through the customer to view the sales history.
