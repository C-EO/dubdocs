Dub Links is the modern link management platform for modern marketing teams.

With Dub, you can [create short links](/help/article/how-to-create-link) using your own [custom domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) and get [world-class analytics](/help/article/dub-analytics) on your links' performance.

<Info>
  Fun fact: The name **Dub** comes from the literal definition of the word

  là what Dub Links does with longer URLs_).
