When you're [configuring your custom domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain), you might run into an issue where clicks on your links might be showing up in a different country/city than expected.

This is most likely because your domain is using a proxy in front of Dub (e.g. [Cloudflare Proxy](/help/article/using-cloudflare-domains#using-cloudflares-proxy)).

This is because using a proxy will send all your click traffic through the proxy
first, then to Dub. This will result in incorrect geolocation data being
presented and the public IP address of your proxy being sent.

To fix this, you should remove the proxy – this will make sure that click requests from your users will be sent directly to Dub and will be accurately recorded.

In Cloudflare's case, you can [use Cloudflare's DNS only mode](/help/article/using-cloudflare-domains#using-cloudflares-dns-only-recommended) instead of using their proxy:
