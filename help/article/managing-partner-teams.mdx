On Dub, Partner teams let you share access to your [Dub partner profile](/help/article/partner-profile) with the people you work with. This is useful for creators, agencies, or anyone who wants more than one person managing partner activity.

## Where to manage your team
To manage your partner team, select the **Partner profile** icon in the left sidebar, then navigate to the **Members** tab.

This view lists everyone with access, including their email and assigned role.

## Roles and permissions
Partner team members support two role types: owner and member.
### Owner
The Owner has full control of the partner account. This includes:
- [Updating partner profile settings](/help/article/partner-profile)
- Managing team members (inviting and removing members)
- [Managing payout details](/help/article/receiving-payouts)
### Member
Members have standard access. They can view and manage partner activity across all programs, but cannot manage team members or payout details.

## Inviting a new member
To invite a new member to your partner team, click the **Invite member** button in the top right.

Enter the member's email address, and select their role. You can invite more than one member at a time, and they'll each receive their own invite email to accept membership.

## Changing a role
Only Owner-roled members in a partner team can change another member’s role. To change a member's role, click the role dropdown in the members table and select a new role.

This will open the confirmation modal, where you can confirm the update:

## Removing a member
To remove a member from your team, click the `⋯` dropdown and select **Remove member**.

This deletes the team member, and the person can no longer sign in to your partner profile.
