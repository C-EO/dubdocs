On Dub, you can set a [workspace of your choice](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace) as your default workspace. This is the workspace that you will be redirected to when you [log in to Dub](https://d.to/register).

When you create your first workspace on Dub, it will automatically be set as your default workspace. However, you can change your default workspace at any time.

Here's how you can change your default workspace on Dub:

1. Go to your [account settings](https://app.dub.co/account/settings) by clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner of the Dub dashboard and selecting **Settings**.
2. Scroll down to the **Your Default Workspace** section.
3. Select the workspace that you want to set as your default workspace from the dropdown list.

4. Click on the **Save Changes** button to save your selection.

That's it! Your default workspace has been updated. The next time you log in to Dub, you will be redirected to your chosen default workspace.
