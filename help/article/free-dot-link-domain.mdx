We're excited to share that we have partnered with [Nova Registry](https://nova.link/) to offer a **1-year free `.link` domain** to Dub users.

This is a great way to get started with [custom domains](https://dub.co/blog/custom-domains) and create short links that match your brand, which gives you [better brand recognition](https://dub.co/blog/custom-domains#better-brand-recognition) and improves click-through rates.

## How to get a free .link domain

To get a free `.link` domain, you need to have a paid plan on Dub ([Pro plan](https://dub.co/pricing) or above). Once you have a paid plan, you can claim your free `.link` domain by following these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to your workspace domain settings">

Go to your [workspace domain settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains). Here you'll see a banner prompting you to claim your free `.link` domain.

Alternatively, if you've dismissed the banner before, you can click on **Add Domain** and then click on the **Claim your free .link domain** button.

You can also claim your free `.link` domain directly in the onboarding flow:

</Step>

<Step title="Search for your .link domain">

Next, search for the `.link` domain that you want to claim. If the domain is unavailable, you'll see a list of alternate domains that you can choose from:

  alt="Search for your .link domain – domain is unavailable"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

If the domain is available, you'll see a **Claim domain** button. Click on the button to claim your free `.link` domain.

  alt="Search for your .link domain – domain is available"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Claim your domain and wait for it to be provisioned">

Once your domain is claimed, it'll show up on your domain dashboard with a **Provisioned by Dub** banner – as well as an amber **Provisioning** badge while your domain is being registered behind the scenes.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

Once the domain is provisioned, you'll see a green **Active** badge next to your domain. This means that your domain is ready to use.

<Info>
  The provisioning process can take anywhere between a few minutes to an hour.
  If your domain is not active after 1 hour, please [reach out to our support
  team](https://dub.co/contact/support).

## Terms and conditions

The free `.link` domain offer is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1. This offer is only available to users who have a paid plan on Dub.
2. Premium `.link` domains (also known as "[registry premium](https://www.dynadot.com/community/help/question/what-are-registry-premium-domains)" domains) are not eligible for this offer.
3. You can only claim one free `.link` domain per [workspace](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace).
4. The free `.link` domain offer lasts for exactly 1 year from the date of claim. A month before the end of the 1-year period, we'll send you an email prompting you to renew your domain – during which you can choose to pay the renewal fee to keep your domain, or let it expire.
5. After the free first year period, the renewal fee will be $12/year ($1/month billed yearly).
6. If you cancel your plan, your existing `.link` domain and links will still work, but you will no longer be able to create new links with it. In this case, we also reserve the right to reassign your `.link` domain to another paying Dub user.
7. We do not currently support transferring your free `.link` domain to another registrar at the moment, but we're planning to add the ability to do so after your first free year.
