On Dub, you can create deep links that lets you to redirect users to a specific page within your mobile application.

For example, you're creating an ad campaign to drive traffic to a specific product page within your mobile app. By following the steps below, you'll be able to make sure that all your short links for your custom domain are set up with deep linking functionality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a custom domain">
    If you haven't already, [add a custom domain to your Dub workspace](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain). If you're on a paid plan on Dub, you can also claim a [complimentary .link custom domain](/help/article/free-dot-link-domain) and use it as your short link domain.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your deep link configuration files">
   Once you've set up your custom domain, you'll need to upload your deep link configuration files to Dub, which we'll host under the `/.well-known/` directory of your domain.

To do that, go to your [workspace domain settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains) page and click on the edit button for your custom domain:

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

In the domain modal, click on **Show advanced settings**, which will open up the Deep Link Configuration settings fields.

**iOS (apple-app-site-association)**

For iOS apps, upload your Apple App Site Association file to enable iOS deep links:

```json title="apple-app-site-association"
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "YOUR_APP_ID",
        "paths": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Android (assetlinks.json)**

For Android apps, upload your AseetLinks file to enable Android deep links:

```json title="assetlinks.json"
[
  {
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": []
    },
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"]
  }
]
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify that your configuration files are set up correctly">

Once you've set up your deep link configuration files, you can go to their respective URLs to verify that they've been configured correctly:

**iOS**: `yourdomain.link/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` ([example](https://getacme.link/.well-known/apple-app-site-association))

**Android**: `yourdomain.link/.well-known/assetlinks.json` ([example](https://getacme.link/.well-known/assetlinks.json))

  </Step>
  <Step title="Whitelist your deep link domain in your app">
    Last but not least, you'll need to whitelist your short link domain in your apps to allow them to redirect straight into a page within your app.

**For iOS apps**, you'll need to [allow websites to link to your apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content/).

**For Android apps**, you'll need to [verify your Android app links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks).

  </Step>
