| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Group name  | Add a name to your group to help easily identify it later. <br /> <br /> **This name is for internal use only and is never visible to your partners.**                                                                                                                                                       |
| Group color | Set the color of the group with our simple color picker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Group slug  | Each partner group uses a unique application landing page, which you can use to share with partners you want to automatically add to that group when they apply. <br /> <br /> **This name is for internal and external use**, so anyone you share the application link with can see the slug name provided. |
| Group ID    | This non-editable item is used for embedding the Dub white-labeled referral dashboard within your app. [Learn more](https://dub.co/docs/partners/white-labeling).                                                                                                                                            |

## Creating rewards

Every partner group can have one of each of the following:

| Reward type                 | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Click-based (pay-per-click) | Rewarding partners for driving clicks to your product – similar to how Google Ads' pay-per-click works.                                            |
| Lead-based (pay-per-lead)   | A more effective alternative to pay-per-click, where you reward partners for leads generated (e.g. demo requests, free trial signups, etc.)        |
| Sale-based (pay-per-sale)   | This is the most common reward type, where you reward partners for driving sales to your product either via a rev-share or fixed-price commission. |

</Frame>

To create a reward, click **Create** on any of the reward types. Learn more about [creating rewards here](/help/article/partner-rewards).

If you want to duplicate your default group rewards on other groups, click **Duplicate default group** to copy over the parameters to save time.

## Creating discounts

You can also create dual-sided incentives for your affiliate/referral programs, which give special discounts to customers who sign up via a referral link.
Some examples include:

- 25% discount for the first 12 months
- 30% lifetime discount
- $50 one-off discount

This can drive powerful word-of-mouth growth as partners are more likely to share their link if it gives their audience/user base additional discounts, and on the other hand, their users are more likely to click on their links as well if they're getting a special deal.

<Frame>

  />
</Frame>

You can create only one discount per group. To create a discount, click **Create** on the discount block.

Learn more about [creating discounts here](/help/article/dual-sided-incentives).

## Group settings

Each group has individual settings that allow you to customize the name and additional settings.

    alt="Group settings"
  />
</Frame>

### Group name

The name of the partner group can be changed at any time. It's for internal use only and is never visible to your partners.

### Group slug

By default, the group slug will auto-generate based on the group name, but you're able to change this at any time. For program landing pages and internal group page URLs.

<Tip>The default group slug cannot be changed.</Tip>

### Group ID

When setting up the [Dub embedded referral dashboard](/docs/partners/embedded-referrals), you'll use this group ID. The ID cannot be changed.

### Payout holding period

Specify how long your commissions will be held in "pending" status before becoming eligible for payout. [Learn more.](/help/article/partner-payouts#payout-holding-period)

### Auto-approve

Enable or disable auto-approving new applicants to this group. [Learn more](/help/article/program-applications#auto-approve).

### Group move rules

Automatically move partners into a selected group when they meet specific criteria. This is useful when you want partners to earn higher rewards as they progress in your program, without needing to manage groups manually.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/move-group.png"
    alt="Example group move settings"
  />
</Frame>

You can move partners based on performance metrics like total leads, conversions, revenue, or commissions. Multiple conditions can be combined so only partners who meet your exact requirements are moved into the selected group.

**Example:** Move partners to the `VIP Group` once their total commissions reach $100.

## Adding partners to a group

There are many ways to add partners to a group, depending on whether they're already enrolled or haven't joined your program yet.

### Inviting partners to apply

After your group is created, when you share the unique application URL, all new applicants who applied through that page will be assigned to that group.

### Approving applications

When reviewing new applications, you'll be asked to confirm their assigned group, and you can also change their assigned group if you need to.

Simply click the checkbox beside their name and click **Add to group** to move them to your desired partner group.
