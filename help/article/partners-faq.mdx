## Payouts & Earnings

### Why is my payout still pending?

Your payout is still [pending](https://dub.co/help/article/commissions-payouts#payout-statuses) because the program hasn't paid its affiliates yet. Please reach out directly to your program to learn more about their payout schedule.

Some programs might also require a minimum payout amount before your payouts can be processed (e.g. Framer requires a [$200 minimum balance](https://www.framer.com/help/articles/getting-started-with-dub/#getting-paid)).

### Why is my commission still pending?

Your commission is pending because there is a [30-day holding period](https://dub.co/help/article/commissions-payouts#what-does-holding-period-mean). After 30 days, your commission will be confirmed and eligible for payout.

### I referred a user but haven't received a commission, what should I do?

If you are certain that you followed the instructions to receive a commission, please wait 48 business hours for the commission to appear. If it is still missing, please reach out to your program and they will investigate.

### My payout is stuck in a "processed" status, what should I do?

If your payout is marked as "processed", it hasn’t been deposited into your connected bank account yet because it is below the $10 minimum for automatic payouts. If you want, you can still [withdraw it for a $0.50 fee](https://dub.co/help/article/receiving-payouts#what-is-the-minimum-withdrawal-amount-and-how-does-it-work). Payouts above $10 are automatically deposited to your bank account at no additional cost.

### Do you support payouts via Payoneer, PayPal, or crypto?

Unfortunately, those payout methods are not supported at this time. We will let you know as soon as anything changes.

## Stripe Express

### Stripe is invite-only in my country, how do I get an invite?

You don't need an invite. Dub uses [Stripe Express](https://support.stripe.com/express) to process payouts, which is different from the standard Stripe account. If your country is supported by Stripe Express, you will be able to see "Connect bank account" under the [Payouts](https://partners.dub.co/settings/payouts) tab.

Here's the full list of countries that we support sending payouts to:

### My country is not supported by Stripe Express, what should I do?

If your country is still not supported by Stripe Express, you can create a legal entity in any of the supported countries above and use that to receive payouts instead. For example, you can create a US LLC (e.g., with [Stripe Atlas](http://stripe.com/atlas)), which would let you receive payouts in USD.

### Can I connect a savings account instead of a checking account?

While it is possible to connect your savings account instead of a checking account, we highly recommend against it for two main reasons:

1. Some banks do not allow third-party deposits into savings accounts, which may cause your payout to fail;
2. Payouts sent to savings accounts can take significantly longer to process (up to 30 business days, depending on the bank), resulting in payout delays.

### My payout is marked as "Paid" on Stripe but it was not deposited, what should I do?

Some banks process payouts longer than usual. Stripe will show the expected arrival date – for example, _"Can’t find your payout? Banks can take up to 5 business days to process payouts. Wait until **[DATE]** and then contact your bank."_

If you still cannot find your payout after the expected arrival date, please contact your bank and ask to locate the payout (you can find the trace ID in your email). Some banks might require additional information from you to release the funds. If your bank cannot find the payout, please reach out to Dub's support and send us:

- a letter from your bank, confirming that the payout was not received;
- your bank statement.

We will reach out to Stripe on your behalf and investigate this further. Once the payout is marked as "Failed" on Stripe, it will be re-sent again to your bank account. Please update your bank account in advance to ensure you can receive your payouts.

**Common reasons why payouts fail:**

- your local bank account is in USD but your local currency is not USD;
- your bank account number is incorrect;
- your bank account name does not match your name on Stripe.

### Can I connect my company's Stripe account to Dub?

No, you need to create a new account on Stripe Express to receive payouts. Stripe Express and Stripe Standard are different account types.
