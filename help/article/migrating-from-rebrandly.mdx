## How to migrate from Rebrandly to Dub

If you're looking to migrate from Rebrandly to Dub, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate your links in a few simple steps.

<Steps>

<Step title="Get your Rebrandly API key">

First, log into your Rebrandly account and navigate to [Account > API](https://app.rebrandly.com/account/api).

If you don't have an API key yet, click on "New API Key", which will create a new API key for you.

Copy the created API key. You'll need it in the next step.

</Step>

<Step title="Use the Rebrandly migration tool">

If you haven't already, [create a workspace on Dub](/help/article/what-is-a-workspace#how-to-create-a-workspace).

<Info>
  **Protip**: Once you create your workspace, we generally recommend you **_not
  to [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain)_** until
  you've migrated all your links. This will prevent any potential downtime for
  your links.
</Info>

Then, from your workspace dashboard, click on the `⋮` button next to the **Create Link** button and select **Import from Rebrandly**.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

You'll be prompted to enter your Rebrandly API key. Paste the API key you copied in the previous step and click **Confirm API Key**.

Behind the scenes, we'll fetch all your Rebrandly custom domains and their respective number of links. You'll be presented with a list of domains that we've found.

/>

</Step>

<Step title="Select the domains you want to migrate">

Select the domains you want to migrate. You can also choose if you'd like to import their respective tags as well. You can learn more about [how tags work on Dub](/help/article/how-to-use-tags).

One you're done, click **Confirm import**. In just a few seconds, all your links and their respective tags will be migrated to Dub.

Once all your links have been imported, we will send you an email to let you know that the migration is complete.

  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain">

Once you receive the email, you can [configure your domain](/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) by setting the right DNS records. This will ensure that your links are pointing to Dub and not Rebrandly. Once you've done this, you can start using your links!
