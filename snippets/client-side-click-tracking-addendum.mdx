If you're using [Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners) for affiliate management, you will also need to set up the `data-domains` property to enable [client-side click-tracking](/docs/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking).

```html
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  defer
  data-domains='{"refer":"yourcompany.link"}' // replace with your referral link domain on Dub
></script>
```

Read the [client-side click-tracking guide](/docs/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) for more information.
