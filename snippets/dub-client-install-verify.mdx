You can **verify the installation** with the following tests:

1. Open the browser console and type in `_dubAnalytics` â€“ if the script is installed correctly, you should see the `_dubAnalytics` object in the console.
2. Add the `?dub_id=test` query parameter to your website URL and make sure that the `dub_id` cookie is being set in your browser.

If both of these checks pass, the script is installed correctly. Otherwise, please make sure:

- The analytics script was added to the `<head>` section of the page
- If you're using a content delivery network (CDN), make sure to purge any cached content
