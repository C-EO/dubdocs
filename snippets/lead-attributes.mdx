Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:

| Property             | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`            | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the click that the lead conversion event is attributed to. You can read this value from `dub_id` cookie. If an empty string is provided (i.e. if you're using [tracking a deferred lead event](/conversions/leads/deferred)), Dub will try to find an existing customer with the provided `customerExternalId` and use the `clickId` from the customer if found. |
| `eventName`          | **Yes**  | The name of the lead event to track. Can also be used as a unique identifier to associate a given lead event for a customer for a subsequent sale event (via the `leadEventName` prop in `/track/sale`).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `customerExternalId` | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `customerEmail`      | No       | The email address of the customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
