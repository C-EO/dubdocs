  Conversion tracking requires a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing)
  subscription or higher.

When it comes to [conversion tracking](/conversions/quickstart), a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product from your online store
