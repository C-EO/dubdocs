<Step title="Generate your publishable key">

Before you can track conversions on the client-side, you need to generate a publishable key from your Dub workspace.

To do that, navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics) and generate a new publishable key under the **Publishable Key** section.
