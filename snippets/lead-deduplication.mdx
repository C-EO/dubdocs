## Deduplication behavior

Lead events are automatically deduplicated to prevent duplicate tracking:

- Events are deduplicated based on the combination of `customerExternalId` (the user ID of the referred customer within your database) and `eventName`
- If you send multiple lead events with the same customer ID and event name, only the first event will be tracked
- Subsequent duplicate events will return `null` and won't be tracked
- Use different event names or customer IDs to track additional events for the same customer
