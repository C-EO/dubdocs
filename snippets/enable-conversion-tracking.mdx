First, you'll need to enable conversion tracking for your Dub links to be able to start tracking conversions.

<Tip>
  If you're using [Dub Partners](/partners/quickstart), you can skip this step
  since partner links will have conversion tracking enabled by default.

There are a few ways to do this:

  <Accordion title="Option 1: On a workspace-level">
    To enable conversion tracking for all future links in a workspace, you can do the following:
To enable conversion tracking for all future links in a workspace, you can do the following:

1. Navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics).
2. Toggle the **Workspace-level Conversion Tracking** switch to enable conversion tracking for the workspace.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/conversions/enable-conversion-tracking-workspace.png"
    alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a workspace"
  />
</Frame>

    This option will enable conversion tracking in the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for all future links.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2: On a link-level">
    If you don't want to enable conversion tracking for all your links in a workspace, you can also opt to enable it on a link-level.

To enable conversion tracking for a specific link, open the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for a link and toggle the **Conversion Tracking** switch.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/conversions/enable-conversion-tracking.png"
    alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a link"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can also use the `C` keyboard shortcut when inside the link builder to
  quickly enable conversion tracking for a given link.
</Tip>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 3: Via the API">
    Alternatively, you can also enable conversion tracking programmatically via the [Dub API](/api-reference/introduction). All you need to do is pass `trackConversion: true` when creating or updating a link:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Node.js
    const link = await dub.links.create({
      url: "https://dub.co",
      trackConversion: true,
    });
    ```

    ```python Python
    link = d.links.create(url="https://dub.co", track_conversion=True)
    ```

    ```go Go
    link, err := d.Links.Create(ctx, &dub.CreateLinkRequest{
        URL: "https://dub.co",
        TrackConversion: true,
    })
    ```

    ```ruby Ruby
    s.links.create_many(
      ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequest.new(
        url: "https://dub.co",
        track_conversion: true,
      )
    )
    ```
