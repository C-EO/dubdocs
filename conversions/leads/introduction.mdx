In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application as lead events on Dub.

<LeadsPrerequisites />

## Configure lead tracking

Depending on which authentication framework you're using, we have a few pre-built guides to help you track lead events when a new user signs up for your SaaS application:

<AuthProviders />

<Tip>
  If you're using the [Remix framework](https://remix.run/), you might run into an [issue](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/7922) where you get an empty/null value for the `dub_id` cookie. In that case, try using a library like [`cookie`](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie) instead:

```typescript
import cookie from "cookie";

const cookies = cookie.parse(request.headers.get("cookie") ?? "");
const dubId = cookies.dub_id;
```

</Tip>

If you're not using any of the frameworks listed above, you can use the following steps to track lead events:

1. Within the sign-up API request, retrieve the `dub_id` cookie that was created by the [`@dub/analytics` client-SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).
2. Send an event to the Dub API with the `dub_id` value, as well as your customer's ID and any other relevant information (email, name, avatar, etc.)

<Tip>
  If you don't have a customer ID, you can also use the customer's `email`
  instead.
</Tip>

## Code examples

Here are some examples of how you can track lead events using our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview):

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";

const dub = new Dub();

const dubId = req.cookies["dub_id"];
if (dubId) {
  await dub.track.lead({
    clickId: dubId,
    eventName: "Sign Up",
    externalId: customer.id,
    customerName: customer.name,
    customerEmail: customer.email,
    customerAvatar: customer.avatar,
  });
  // delete the dub_id cookie
  res.cookies.set("dub_id", "", {
    expires: new Date(0),
  });
}
```

```python Python
from dub import Dub
import os

dub = Dub(token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'])

dub_id = request.cookies.get('dub_id')
if dub_id:
    dub.track.lead({
        'click_id': dub_id,
        'event_name': 'Sign Up',
        'external_id': customer.id,
        'customer_name': customer.name,
        'customer_email': customer.email,
        'customer_avatar': customer.avatar
    })
    # delete the dub_id cookie
    response.delete_cookie('dub_id')
```

```go Go
package main

import (
    "context"
    dub "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
    "net/http"
)

d := dub.New(
    dub.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)

dubId, err := r.Cookie("dub_id")
if err == nil {
    _, err = d.Track.Lead(context.Background(), &operations.TrackLeadRequest{
        ClickId:         dubId.Value,
        EventName:       "Sign Up",
        ExternalId:      customer.ID,
        CustomerName:    customer.Name,
        CustomerEmail:   customer.Email,
        CustomerAvatar:  customer.Avatar,
    })
    // delete the dub_id cookie
    http.SetCookie(w, &http.Cookie{
        Name:    "dub_id",
        Value:   "",
        Expires: time.Unix(0, 0),
    })
}
```

```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'

dub = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
dub.config_security(
  ::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
    token: ENV['DUB_API_KEY']
  )
)

dub_id = cookies[:dub_id]
if dub_id
  req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::TrackLeadRequest.new(
    click_id: dub_id,
    event_name: 'Sign Up',
    external_id: customer.id,
    customer_name: customer.name,
    customer_email: customer.email,
    customer_avatar: customer.avatar
  )
  dub.track.lead(req)
  # delete the dub_id cookie
  cookies.delete(:dub_id)
end
```

```php PHP
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Dub\Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;

$dub = Dub::builder()->setSecurity($_ENV["DUB_API_KEY"])->build();

$dubId = $_COOKIE['dub_id'] ?? null;
if ($dubId) {
    $request = new Operations\TrackLeadRequest();
    $request->clickId = $dubId;
    $request->eventName = 'Sign Up';
    $request->externalId = $customer->id;
    $request->customerName = $customer->name;
    $request->customerEmail = $customer->email;
    $request->customerAvatar = $customer->avatar;

    $dub->track->lead($request);
    // delete the dub_id cookie
    setcookie('dub_id', '', time() - 3600);
}
```
