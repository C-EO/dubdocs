This guide shows you how to track lead conversions from HubSpot Forms and Meetings Scheduler.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to set up Dub Conversions for your links:

1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)

## Install HubSpot Integration

Install the [HubSpot Dub Integration](https://dub.co/integrations/hubspot) to your workspace.

## HubSpot Form

HubSpot Form help you capture lead information and track conversions. By integrating with Dub, you can attribute each form submission back to the specific Dub link that drove the conversion.

To make attribution work, you need to capture the `dub_id` cookie in your HubSpot form. This ensures each lead is tied back to the exact Dub link they came from.

Here's how you can set it up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new property">
    In HubSpot, create a new property under the Contact object:

    - Label: Dub Id
    - Group: Contact information
    - Field type: Single-line text
    - Visibility options: set to Show property in forms and bots
    - Internal name: must be `dub_id`

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/conversions/hubspot/hubspot-dub-id-property.png"
        alt="Segment Dub (Actions) Mapping"
        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a hidden field to your form">
    In the HubSpot form builder, add a hidden field and map it to the Dub Id
    property you just created.
    
    This makes sure the value captured by your script is stored on the contact record. Without mapping to a property, HubSpot won’t persist the `dub_id` value.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/conversions/hubspot/hubspot-forms-setup.png"
        alt="Segment Dub (Actions) Mapping"
        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the script to your site">
    Finally, add the following snippet to your site. The script reads the `dub_id` cookie and, if found, automatically fills the hidden Dub Id form field with its value.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```html HTML
    <script src="https://js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/47839131.js" defer></script>

    <div
      class="hs-form-frame"
      data-region="na1"
      data-form-id="YOUR_FORM_ID"
      data-portal-id="YOUR_PORTAL_ID"
    ></div>

    <script>
      // A helper function to get the value of a cookie
      function getCookie(name) {
        const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
        const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);

        if (parts.length === 2) {
          return parts.pop().split(";").shift();
        }

        return null;
      }

      // Listen for the form ready event
      window.addEventListener("hs-form-event:on-ready", (event) => {
        const clickId = getCookie("dub_id");

        if (!clickId) {
          console.debug("clickId not found. Skipping lead tracking.");
          return;
        }

        // Populate the hidden field with the dub_id
        HubSpotFormsV4.getForms()[0].setFieldValue("0-1/dub_id", clickId);
      });
    </script>
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    When the form is ready, the script checks for the `dub_id` and, if found, automatically sets it into a hidden `Dub Id` field on the form.

    This way, when a prospect submits the form, the `dub_id` is captured and passed to HubSpot, ensuring the lead is attributed back to the original Dub link.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Meetings Scheduler

HubSpot's Meetings Scheduler lets prospects book time directly with you or your team.

Since HubSpot doesn't let you add a hidden field to the scheduling form, you should handle initial lead tracking through deferred lead tracking on the client side.

Use the following code to track lead conversions when meetings are booked through the HubSpot scheduler.

The script listens for booking events from HubSpot, extracts the customer’s details (name and email), and then calls `dubAnalytics.trackLead()` with deferred lead tracking.

This way, the lead is only tracked after the meeting is confirmed, ensuring accurate attribution.

```html
<div
  class="meetings-iframe-container"
  data-src="https://meetings.hubspot.com/YOUR_USERNAME?embed=true"
></div>

<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://static.hsappstatic.net/MeetingsEmbed/ex/MeetingsEmbedCode.js"
></script>

<script>
  function getCookie(name) {
    const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
    const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);

    if (parts.length === 2) {
      return parts.pop().split(";").shift();
    }

    return null;
  }

  // Listen for the message event
  window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
    // Check if the message is from the scheduling widget
    if (event.origin === "https://meetings.hubspot.com") {
      const clickId = getCookie("dub_id");

      if (!clickId) {
        console.debug("clickId not found. Skipping lead tracking.");
        return;
      }

      // Get the data from the event
      const data = event.data;

      if (data.meetingBookSucceeded) {
        // Get the scheduled contact
        const contact =
          data.meetingsPayload.bookingResponse.postResponse.contact;

        if (!contact) {
          console.debug("contact not found. Skipping lead tracking.");
          return;
        }

        // Track the lead with the scheduled contact
        const customerName = [contact.firstName, contact.lastName]
          .filter(Boolean)
          .join(" ");

        dubAnalytics.trackLead({
          clickId,
          mode: "deferred",
          eventName: "Meeting scheduled",
          customerExternalId: contact.email,
          customerName: customerName,
          customerEmail: contact.email,
        });
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```
