<Warning>
  Client-side conversion tracking comes with some limitations: - **Ad
  blockers**: Users with ad blockers may prevent tracking scripts from loading -
  **JavaScript disabled**: Events won't be tracked if users have JavaScript
  disabled - **Network issues**: Failed network requests won't retry
  automatically - **Privacy concerns**: Some users may block client-side
  tracking for privacy reasons For more accurate conversion tracking, consider
  using [server-side conversion tracking](/api-reference/endpoint/track-lead).
