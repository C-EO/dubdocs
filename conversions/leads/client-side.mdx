## When to track leads

You should track lead events after successful user actions such as:

  - User registration or account creation
  - Newsletter subscription
  - Contact form submission
  - Demo request or trial signup
  - Download of gated content
  
Ensure the event is triggered **only after the backend confirms the action was completed successfully**. This guarantees accurate lead data and prevents false or incomplete entries.

<Warning>
  Client-side conversion tracking comes with some limitations:
  
  - **Ad blockers**: Users with ad blockers may prevent tracking scripts from loading
  - **JavaScript disabled**: Events won't be tracked if users have JavaScript disabled
  - **Network issues**: Failed network requests won't retry automatically
  - **Privacy concerns**: Some users may block client-side tracking for privacy reasons
  
  For more accurate conversion tracking, consider using [server-side conversion tracking](/api-reference/endpoint/track-lead).
</Warning>
