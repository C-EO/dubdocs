Client-Side Conversion Tracking Limitations:
- **Ad blockers** – Users with ad blockers may prevent tracking scripts from loading.
- **JavaScript disabled** – Events won’t be tracked if users have JavaScript disabled.
- **Network issues** – Failed network requests won’t retry automatically.
- **Privacy concerns** – Some users may block client-side tracking for privacy reasons.

For more accurate conversion tracking, consider using [server-side conversion tracking](/docs/conversions/leads/introduction)
