<Note>
  Dub Conversions require a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing) subscription
  or higher.
</Note>

[Dub Conversions](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions) is a powerful tool that lets you turn any [short link you create on Dub](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link) into a full attribution engine. This allows you to understand how well your links are translating to actual users and revenue dollars.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Dub Conversions:

1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-2-install-the-dub-analytics-client-side-sdk)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
4. [Start sending events](#step-4-start-sending-events)
5. [View your conversions](#step-5-view-your-conversions)

## Step 1: Enable conversion tracking for your links

First, you'll need to enable conversion tracking for your Dub links to be able to start tracking conversions.

There are a few ways to do this:

1. [On a workspace-level](#option-1-on-a-workspace-level)
2. [On a link-level](#option-2-on-a-link-level)
3. [Via the API](#option-3-via-the-api)

### Option 1: On a workspace-level

To enable conversion tracking for all future links in a workspace, you can do the following:

1. Navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics).
2. Toggle the **Workspace-level Conversion Tracking** switch to enable conversion tracking for the workspace.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/conversions/enable-conversion-tracking-workspace.png"
    alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a workspace"
  />
</Frame>

This option will enable conversion tracking in the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for all future links.

### Option 2: On a link-level

If you don't want to enable conversion tracking for all your links in a workspace, you can also opt to enable it on a link-level.

To enable conversion tracking for a specific link, open the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for a link and toggle the **Conversion Tracking** switch.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/conversions/enable-conversion-tracking.png"
    alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a link"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can also use the `C` keyboard shortcut when inside the link builder to
  quickly enable conversion tracking for a given link.
</Tip>

### Option 3: Via the API

Alternatively, you can also enable conversion tracking programmatically via the [Dub API](/api-reference/introduction). All you need to do is pass `trackConversion: true` when creating or updating a link:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
const link = await dub.links.create({
  url: "https://dub.co",
  trackConversion: true,
});
```

```python Python
link = d.links.create(url="https://dub.co", track_conversion=True)
```

```go Go
link, err := d.Links.Create(ctx, &dub.CreateLinkRequest{
    URL: "https://dub.co",
    TrackConversion: true,
})
```

```ruby Ruby
s.links.create_many(
  ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequest.new(
    url: "https://dub.co",
    track_conversion: true,
  )
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

Next, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This will handle the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

  />
</Frame>

## Step 3: Install the Dub server-side SDK

<Tip>
  If you are using Shopify, you can skip this step since our Shopify app will
  automatically track conversions for you. Read the [Shopify integration
  guide](/sdks/client-side/installation-guides/shopify) for more information.
</Tip>

Dub Conversions uses server-side event tracking to track conversions. Depending on which framework you're using, you can use our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview):

  <Card title="Ruby" icon="gem" href="/sdks/quickstart/ruby" horizontal>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you're using a framework that isn't listed, you can use the Dub REST API to track events on the server-side:

- [Tracking a lead event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-lead)
- [Tracking a sale event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale)

## Step 4: Start sending events

<Tip>
  If you are using Shopify, you can skip this step since our Shopify app will
  automatically track conversions for you. Read the [Shopify integration
  guide](/sdks/client-side/installation-guides/shopify) for more information.
</Tip>

Now that you've installed the SDKs, you can start sending events to Dub. Since click events are tracked automatically, you'll only need to send events for the following cases:

- [Lead events](#step-4a-sending-lead-events)
- [Sale events](#step-4b-sending-sale-events)

### Step 4a: Sending Lead Events

The first event you'll want to send is a `lead` event. This happens when a user performs an action that indicates interest in your product or service. This could be anything from:

- Signing up for an account
- Adding a product to cart
- Joining a mailing list

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-lead-event.png"
    alt="A diagram showing how lead events are tracked in the conversion funnel"
  />
</Frame>

Our most common lead event is `Sign Up`, which happens when a user signs up for an account. Depending on which authentication framework you're using, here are a few examples of how to send `Sign Up` lead events:

<AuthProviders />

<Tip>
  If you're using the [Remix framework](https://remix.run/), you might run into an [issue](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/7922) where you get an empty/null value for the `dub_id` cookie. In that case, try using a library like [`cookie`](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie) instead:

```typescript
import cookie from "cookie";

const cookies = cookie.parse(request.headers.get("cookie") ?? "");
const dubId = cookies.dub_id;
```

</Tip>

<LeadAttributes />

The lead event will serve as the source of truth for the customer's identity and which link they came from. This means that all subsequent actions performed by the customer (e.g. upgrading their plan, purchasing a product) will automatically be attributed to the original link.

### Step 4b: Sending Sale Events

The second event you'll want to send is a `sale` event. This happens when a user purchases your product or service. This could be anything from:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-sale-event.png"
    alt="A diagram showing how sale events are tracked in the conversion funnel"
  />

Depending on which payment processor you're using, we offer native integrations for the following:

</CardGroup>

Alternatively, you can also send sale events manually using [our SDKs](/sdks/overview) or the [`POST /track/sale` API endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale).

<SaleAttributes />

## Step 5: View your conversions

Once you've enabled conversion tracking for your links, all your tracked conversions will show up on your [Analytics dashboard](https://app.dub.co/analytics). We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:
