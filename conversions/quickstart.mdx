1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-2%3A-install-the-%40dub%2Fanalytics-client-side-sdk)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK + track conversion events](#step-3%3A-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk-%2B-track-conversion-events)

## Step 2: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

Next, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.
