[Dub Conversions](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions) is a powerful tool that lets you turn any [short link you create on Dub](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link) into a full attribution engine. This allows you to understand how well your links are translating to actual users and revenue dollars.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Dub Conversions:

1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-2-install-the-dub-analytics-client-side-sdk)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK + track conversion events](#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk-track-conversion-events)
4. [View your conversions](#step-4-view-your-conversions)

## Step 1: Enable conversion tracking for your links

First, you'll need to enable conversion tracking for your Dub links to be able to start tracking conversions.

There are a few ways to do this:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: On a workspace-level">
    To enable conversion tracking for all future links in a workspace, you can do the following:
To enable conversion tracking for all future links in a workspace, you can do the following:

1. Navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics).
2. Toggle the **Workspace-level Conversion Tracking** switch to enable conversion tracking for the workspace.

  />
</Frame>

    This option will enable conversion tracking in the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for all future links.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2: On a link-level">
    If you don't want to enable conversion tracking for all your links in a workspace, you can also opt to enable it on a link-level.

To enable conversion tracking for a specific link, open the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for a link and toggle the **Conversion Tracking** switch.

<Tip>
  You can also use the `C` keyboard shortcut when inside the link builder to
  quickly enable conversion tracking for a given link.
</Tip>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 3: Via the API">
    Alternatively, you can also enable conversion tracking programmatically via the [Dub API](/api-reference/introduction). All you need to do is pass `trackConversion: true` when creating or updating a link:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Node.js
    const link = await dub.links.create({
      url: "https://dub.co",
      trackConversion: true,
    });
    ```

    ```python Python
    link = d.links.create(url="https://dub.co", track_conversion=True)
    ```

    ```go Go
    link, err := d.Links.Create(ctx, &dub.CreateLinkRequest{
        URL: "https://dub.co",
        TrackConversion: true,
    })
    ```

    ```ruby Ruby
    s.links.create_many(
      ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequest.new(
        url: "https://dub.co",
        track_conversion: true,
      )
    )
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 2: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

Next, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.
