Clicks are the starting point for all conversion events on Dub.

A click event can be triggered by:

- A user clicking on a [Dub link](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link)
- A user scanning a [Dub QR code](https://dub.co/features/qr-codes)

In [Dub Analytics](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics), you can [filter between QR code scans and link clicks](https://dub.co/help/article/filter-analytics-by-trigger), giving you a full picture of how your various marketing channels are performing.

Clicks are tracked automatically for all Dub short links upon a redirect event – and you also have the flexibility to track clicks via query parameters using our [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

## Server-side click-tracking

Server-side click-tracking is enabled by default for all Dub links and come with the following attributes:

| Attribute    | Type    | Description                                                                                      |
| :----------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`  | string  | The timestamp of the click event                                                                 |
| `id`         | string  | The unique ID of the click event                                                                 |
| `url`        | string  | The destination URL that the link resolved to – this can vary if geo/device-targeting is enabled |
| `continent`  | string  | The continent of the user who clicked the link                                                   |
| `country`    | string  | The country of the user who clicked the link                                                     |
| `city`       | string  | The city of the user who clicked the link                                                        |
| `device`     | string  | The device of the user who clicked the link                                                      |
| `browser`    | string  | The browser of the user who clicked the link                                                     |
| `os`         | string  | The operating system of the user who clicked the link                                            |

| `refererUrl` | string  | The full referrer URL of the user who clicked the link                                           |
| `qr`         | boolean | Whether the click event was triggered by a QR code scan                                          |
| `ip`         | string  | The IP address of the user who clicked the link (non-EU users only)                              |

These events happen on the server-side and cannot be blocked by browser extensions or ad-blockers, which improves the accuracy of your analytics data.

## Client-side click-tracking

Alternatively, you can track clicks on the client-side using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`, `?ref=jane`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.

A few use cases include:

- You are migrating from an existing affiliate management platform that uses query parameters to track conversions and don't want ask your affiliates to update all their links
- You have dynamically generated referral pages (e.g. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/referral/peeroke520149)) and want to track clicks using a `track()` function inside your application code.
- You need to use an unfurled URL for the platform you're sharing the link on (no short links allowed)

With our [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction), you can do exactly that. Here's how you can enable client-side click-tracking for your links:

### Step 1: Add a custom domain to your Dub workspace

First, you'll need to [add a custom short link domain](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) to your Dub workspace.

This is the domain that you'll use for your short links on Dub.

### Step 2: Allowlist the your site's domain

Then, you'll need to allowlist your site's domain to allow the client-side click events to be ingested by Dub. To do that, navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics) and add your site's domain to the **Allowed Hostnames** list.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/conversions/allowed-hostnames.png"
    alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a workspace"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  When testing things out locally, you can add `localhost` to the **Allowed
  Hostnames** list temporarily. This will allow local events to be ingested by
  Dub. Don't forget to remove it once you're ready to go live!
</Tip>

### Step 3: Install the Dub Client-side SDK

Lastly, you'll need to install the Dub [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction) and initialize it with the domain you added in the previous step.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React/Next.js
// install the package (e.g. npm install @dub/analytics)
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <DubAnalytics
        domainsConfig={{
          refer: "go.example.com", // the custom domain you're using on Dub for your short links
        }}
        queryParam="via" // optional: query parameter to listen to for client-side click-tracking (default: "via")
      />
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  data-domains='{"refer": "go.example.com"}'
  defer
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

Here's the full list of parameters you can pass to the `<Analytics />` component:

<Accordion title="Parameters">
  <DubAnalyticsParams />
</Accordion>

### Step 4 (Optional, but recommended): Set up a reverse proxy

To avoid ad-blockers from blocking your click-tracking requests, we recommend setting up a reverse proxy.

Depending on which backend framework you're using, there are a few different ways to do this:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Next.js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/_proxy/dub/track/:path",
        destination: "https://api.dub.co/track/:path",
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

```json Vercel
// vercel.json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/_proxy/dub/track/:path",
      "destination": "https://api.dub.co/track/:path"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Once you've set up your reverse proxy, don't forget to update the `apiHost` parameter in the `<Analytics />` component to point to your proxy URL.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React/Next.js
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <DubAnalytics
        apiHost="/_proxy/dub" // the URL of your reverse proxy
        domainsConfig={{
          refer: "go.example.com", // the custom domain you're using on Dub for your short links
        }}
        queryParam="via" // optional: query parameter to listen to for client-side click-tracking (default: "via")
      />
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  data-api-host="/_proxy/dub"
  data-domains='{"refer": "go.example.com"}'
  defer
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 5: Verify your setup

To verify that your click-tracking is working, run your website locally and append the URL with:

- The specific query parameter + you specified in [Step 3](#step-3-install-the-dub-client-side-sdk)
- The unique key of your short link

For example, if the query parameter you specified in Step 3 is `via` and your short link is `https://go.example.com/abc123`, you'll need to append `?via=abc123` to the URL.

Once you've done that, check if the following is true:

1. The click tracked correctly in the [**Analytics**](https://app.dub.co/analytics) tab of your Dub workspace.
2. There is a successful `/track/click` request in your browser's **Network** tab (and no errors in the **Console** tab).
3. The `dub_id` cookie is being set in your browser upon a successful click-tracking request.
