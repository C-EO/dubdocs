When it comes to [conversion tracking](/conversions/quickstart), a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)

## When to track sale

Track sale events only after a user successfully completes a purchase or payment-related action, such as:

  - Completing a checkout or order
  - Subscription payment
  - Invoice payment
  - Any paid trial or demo conversion
  
Ensure the event is triggered **only after the backend confirms the payment was successful**. This guarantees accurate sale data and prevents false or incomplete entries.

<Warning>
  Client-side conversion tracking comes with some limitations:
  
  - **Ad blockers**: Users with ad blockers may prevent tracking scripts from loading
  - **JavaScript disabled**: Events won't be tracked if users have JavaScript disabled
  - **Network issues**: Failed network requests won't retry automatically
  - **Privacy concerns**: Some users may block client-side tracking for privacy reasons
  
  For more accurate conversion tracking, consider using [server-side conversion tracking](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale).
</Warning>
