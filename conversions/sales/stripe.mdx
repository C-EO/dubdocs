When it comes to conversion tracking, a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sale events with Stripe as the payment processor by leveraging Dub's Stripe integration.

<SalesPrerequisites />

<Tip>
  Alternatively, if your setup doesn't involve an authentication step (e.g. for
  one-time purchases / if you're using [Stripe Payment
  Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)), you can skip the server-side
  SDK step above and just [pass the Dub click ID to the Stripe Checkout Flow
  (instructions
  below)](#option-3-pass-the-dub-click-id-to-the-stripe-checkout-flow).
</Tip>

## Step 1: Install the Dub Stripe integration

<Steps>
<Step title="Find Dub on the Stripe App Marketplace">
 Navigate to the [Dub: Conversions Analytics page](https://d.to/stripe/app) on the Stripe App Marketplace.

</Frame>

</Step>
<Step title="Install the Stripe app">
  On the top right, click on **Install app** to install the Dub Conversions app on your Stripe account.

  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Alternatively, you can also install the Stripe app in test mode first to test
  your end-to-end flow without involving real money.
</Tip>

Once the app is installed, click on **Continue to app settings** to finish the installation.

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="Continue to app settings"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect Stripe to your Dub workspace">

In the app settings page, click on **Connect workspace** to connect your Stripe account with your Dub workspace.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-connect-workspace.png"
    alt="Connect Stripe to Dub"
  />
</Frame>

This will redirect you to the [Dub OAuth flow](/integrations/quickstart), where you can select the Dub workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/select-dub-workspace.png"
    alt="Select the Dub workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account"
  />
</Frame>

Once you click on **Authorize**, you will be redirected back to the Dub app settings page on Stripe, where you should see that the integration is now installed.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-installed.png"
    alt="The Stripe integration is now installed"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

</Steps>
Dub's Stripe integration will automatically forward the following events to Dub:

- `customer.created`: When a new customer is created
- `checkout.session.completed`: When a customer completes a checkout session
- `invoice.paid`: When an invoice is paid (for tracking recurring subscriptions)

## Step 2: Associate Stripe customer with your customer ID

Next, we'll need to associate the [Stripe customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) with the user ID in your database (which we tracked in the [lead conversion tracking step](/conversions/leads/introduction)).

This will allow Dub to automatically listen for purchase events from Stripe and associate them with the original click event (and by extension, the link that the user came from).

<Accordion title="How does this work?">

Remember in the [lead conversion tracking guide](/conversions/leads/introduction), we passed the user's unique user ID along with the click event ID in the `dub.track.lead` call?

```typescript
await dub.track.lead({
  clickId,
  eventName: "Sign Up",
  externalId: user.id,
  customerName: user.name,
  customerEmail: user.email,
  customerAvatar: user.image,
});
```

Under the hood, Dub records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from.

Then, when the user makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.

</Accordion>

There are 3 ways to associate the Stripe customer object with the user ID in your database:

1. [Include your customer's unique user ID in checkout sessions](#option-1-include-your-customers-unique-user-id-in-checkout-sessions)
2. [Pass the user ID and the click event ID in the Stripe customer creation flow](#option-2-pass-the-user-id-and-the-click-event-id-in-the-stripe-customer-creation-flow)
3. [Pass the Dub click ID to the Stripe Checkout Flow](#option-3-pass-the-dub-click-id-to-the-stripe-checkout-flow)

### Option 1: Include your customer's unique user ID in checkout sessions

When you [create checkout sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create) for your users, pass your customer's unique user ID in your database as the `dubCustomerId` value in the `metadata` field.

```typescript app/api/upgrade/route.ts
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const priceId = "price_xxxxxxxxx";

const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  customer_email: user.email,
  success_url: "https://app.domain.com/success",
  line_items: [{ price: priceId, quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "subscription",
  client_reference_id: user.teamId,
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
  },
});
```

This way, when the customer completes their checkout session, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.

### Option 2: Pass the user ID and the click event ID in the Stripe customer creation flow

Alternatively, if you don't use Stripe's checkout session creation flow, you can also pass the user ID and the click event ID (`dub_id`) in the [Stripe customer creation flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create):

```typescript app/api/create-customer/route.ts
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const dub_id = req.headers.get("dub_id");

await stripe.customers.create({
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerId: user.id,
    dubClickId: dub_id,
  },
});
```

This way, when the customer makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the purchase details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the original click event.

### Option 3: Pass the Dub click ID to the Stripe Checkout Flow

If your setup doesn't involve a [lead event](/conversions/leads/introduction) and goes straight to the Stripe checkout flow (e.g. for one-time purchases), you can simply pass the Dub click ID as the `client_reference_id` parameter to enable conversion tracking with Dub.

<Tip>
  When passing the Dub click ID as the `client_reference_id` parameter to
  Stripe, remember to **prefix it with `dub_id_`** to allow Dub to detect the
  conversion event.
</Tip>

- For [Stripe Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) – pass it as a [query parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters):

  ```
  https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxxx?client_reference_id=dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

- For [Stripe Pricing Tables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) – pass it as a [`client-reference-id` attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#handle-fulfillment-with-the-stripe-api):

    // Paste the stripe-pricing-table snippet in your React component
    return (
      <stripe-pricing-table

        publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
        client-reference-id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      ></stripe-pricing-table>
    );
  }

  export default PricingPage;
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

- For [Stripe Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) – pass it as the [`client_reference_id` parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-client_reference_id):

  <CodeGroup>

  ```typescript TypeScript
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    success_url: "https://example.com/success",
    line_items: [
      {
        price: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        quantity: 2,
      },
    ],
    mode: "payment",
    client_reference_id: "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  });
  ```

  ```python Python
    stripe.checkout.Session.create(
      success_url="https://example.com/success",
      line_items=[{"price": "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "quantity": 2}],
      mode="payment",
      client_reference_id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    )
  ```

  ```go Go
    params := &stripe.CheckoutSessionParams{
      SuccessURL: stripe.String("https://example.com/success"),
      LineItems: []*stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
        &stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
          Price: stripe.String("price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
          Quantity: stripe.Int64(2),
        },
      },
      Mode: stripe.String(string(stripe.CheckoutSessionModePayment)),
      ClientReferenceID: stripe.String("dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
    };
    result, err := session.New(params);
  ```

  ```php PHP
    $stripe->checkout->sessions->create([
      'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success',
      'line_items' => [
        [
          'price' => 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
          'quantity' => 2,
        ],
      ],
      'mode' => 'payment',
      'client_reference_id' => "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    ]);
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
    Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
      success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
      line_items: [
        {
          price: 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
          quantity: 2,
        },
      ],
      mode: 'payment',
      client_reference_id: "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    })
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

Behind the scenes, Dub will automatically detect when the user completes the checkout flow and track the customer as a [lead](/conversions/leads/introduction) and the purchase event as a [sale](/conversions/sales/introduction).

In this case, we will also [update the customer's `externalId`](/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-customer) with their Stripe customer ID for future reference.

## Step 3: View conversion results

And that's it – you're all set! You can now sit back, relax, and watch your conversion revenue grow. We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:

<ViewConversions />

## Currency support

For simplicity, Dub records all sales in the native currency of the Stripe account. For example, if you're using USD for your Stripe account, Dub will record all sales in USD.

If you're using [Stripe's Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing) feature, Dub will still record the sale amount using the currency of your Stripe account:

```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
  "id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
  "object": "event",
  "type": "checkout.session.completed",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
      "object": "checkout.session",
      "currency": "cad",
      "amount_subtotal": 2055,
      "amount_total": 2055,
      "currency_conversion": {
        "amount_subtotal": 1500,
        "amount_total": 1500, // this is the amount that Dub will record
        "source_currency": "usd", // the currency of your Stripe account
        "fx_rate": "1.37"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
