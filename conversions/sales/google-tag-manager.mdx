In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sales events for a SaaS application that uses Google Tag Manager to track conversions.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:

1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK via GTM](/sdks/client-side/installation-guides/google-tag-manager)

## Configure Google Tag Manager server-side tracking

To track sales conversion events with Google Tag Manager, you'll need to set up a server container and configure a custom client to handle Dub conversion events.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Set up Server Container">

    In Google Tag Manager, you'll need to use an existing server container or create a new one. Server containers are the foundation for server-side tracking and allow you to process events before they reach their final destinations.

    - If you already have a server container set up, you can use that
    - If not, create a new server container in your GTM workspace

  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Dub GTM Server Client Template">

    <Note>
      If you've already set up the Dub GTM Server Client for lead tracking, you can skip this step and the next step.
    </Note>

    Add a new Client Template using the import option:

    1. In your server container, go to **Client Templates** → **New**
    2. Click **Import** and upload the [Dub GTM Server Client template](https://github.com/dubinc/gtm-server-client-template)

        alt="GTM Server Client Template"
        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Dub Server Client">

    <Note>
      If you've already set up the Dub GTM Server Client for lead tracking, you can skip this step.
    </Note>

    Next, create a new Client using the imported template:

    1. In your server container, go to **Clients** → **New**
    2. Select the **Dub GTM Server Client** template from **Custom**
    3. Name the client "Dub Server Client" (or any descriptive name)
    4. Set the **Request Path** to `/dub/track`
    5. Optionally enable debug logging for troubleshooting

        alt="GTM Server Client"
        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

    **Note:** Clients in GTM Server are adapters that act as bridges between the software running on a user's device and your server container. They receive requests and transform them into events that can be processed by tags.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Dub GTM Server Tag Template">

    <Note>
      If you've already imported the Dub GTM Server Tag template for lead tracking, you can skip this step.
    </Note>

    Next, import the Dub GTM Server Tag template to handle sales tracking:

    1. In your server container, go to **Tags** → **New**
    2. Click **Import** and upload the [Dub GTM Server Tag template](https://github.com/dubinc/gtm-server-tag-template)
    3. This template is specifically designed to send conversion events directly to Dub

        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Sales Tracking Tag">

    Next, create a new tag for sales tracking with proper mapping:

    1. In your server container, go to **Tags** → **New**
    2. Select the **Dub Conversion Tag** template from **Custom**
    3. Name the tag "Dub Sales Tracking" (or any descriptive name)
    4. Configure the tag settings:


       - **Dub API Key**: Enter your [Dub API key](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/tokens) (starts with `dub_`)
       - **Event**: Select "Track sale"
       - **Customer External ID**: Map to the `customerExternalId` from the event data
       - **Amount**: Map to the `amount` from the event data (in cents)
       - **Currency**: Map to the `currency` from the event data (e.g., "usd")
       - **Event Name**: Map to the `eventName` from the event data (e.g., "Purchase")
       - **Payment Processor**: Map to the `paymentProcessor` from the event data (e.g., "stripe")
       - **Invoice ID**: Map to the `invoiceId` from the event data (optional)
       - **Lead Event Name**: Map to the `leadEventName` from the event data (optional)
       - **Metadata**: Map to the `metadata` from the event data (optional)

    5. **Triggering**: Configure when the tag should fire:
       - Click **Triggering** in the tag configuration
       - Click **+** to add a new trigger
       - Select **Custom Event** as the trigger type
       - Set the **Event Name** to match the event name from the Dub Server Client. Default is `dub_conversion`
       - Add a condition to filter for sales events:
         - **Variable**: Select a variable that contains the event type
         - **Operator**: Equals
         - **Value**: "Purchase"
       - Name the trigger "Dub Sales Event Trigger" and save it

## Testing your setup

You can test your GTM server setup by sending a curl request to your server URL with the appropriate query parameters:

```bash
curl "https://server-side-tagging-xxx-uc.a.run.app/dub/track/sale?\
customerExternalId=user_1K0RN3SDNAC0C1WCW4BGRS3EW&\
amount=1000&\
currency=usd&\
eventName=Purchase&\
paymentProcessor=stripe&\
invoiceId=inv_123456789&\
leadEventName=Sign%20Up"
```
