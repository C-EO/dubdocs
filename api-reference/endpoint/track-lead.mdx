<Note>
  Conversions endpoints require a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing)
  subscription or higher.
</Note>

## Deduplication behavior

The `/track/lead` endpoint automatically deduplicates lead events based on the combination of `customerExternalId` and `eventName`. This means:

- If you send multiple lead events with the same `customerExternalId` and `eventName`, only the first event will be tracked
- Subsequent requests with the same combination will return `null` for the link and the event will not be recorded
- To track additional events for the same customer, use a different `eventName` or `customerExternalId`

<Warning>
  Make sure to use unique event names or customer IDs if you need to track multiple lead events for the same customer.
</Warning>

### Example

```javascript
// First request - will be tracked
await dub.track.lead({
  customerExternalId: "customer_123",
  eventName: "signup"
});

// Second request with same customerExternalId + eventName - will be deduplicated
await dub.track.lead({
  customerExternalId: "customer_123", 
  eventName: "signup" // Same combination - returns null
});

// Third request with different eventName - will be tracked
await dub.track.lead({
  customerExternalId: "customer_123",
  eventName: "activated" // Different eventName - will be tracked
});
```
