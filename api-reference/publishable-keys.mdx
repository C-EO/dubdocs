Publishable keys on Dub allow you to safely embed authentication in client-side applications.
These keys are specifically designed to be used with [Dub's client-side SDKs](/sdks/client-side/introduction) for features like [conversion tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/conversion-tracking).

Unlike [API keys](/api-reference/api-keys) which must be kept secret, publishable keys can be safely exposed in your frontend code since they have limited capabilities.

Publishable keys on Dub follow the format:

```bash .env
DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=dub_pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
