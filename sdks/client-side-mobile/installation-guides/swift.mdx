## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Obtain your [publishable key](/api-reference/publishable-keys) (`DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) from your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics) and allowlist your site's domain (`DUB_DOMAIN`) to allow the client-side conversion events to be ingested by Dub.

2. (Optional) If you plan to track conversions, follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to [enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links).
