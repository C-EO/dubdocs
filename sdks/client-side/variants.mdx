Inspired by [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), our script is split into multiple variants to help you optimize your script for different use cases.

This allows us to keep the base variant of the script as lightweight as possible (~1kb) while still allowing you to use the script in more complex use cases.

## Syntax

The base script is available on [`script.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js), and all variants are available on `script.[variant].js`.

For instance, the `outbound-domains` variant is available on [`script.outbound-domains.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.outbound-domains.js).

You can also mix and match variants. For example, you can use the `site-visit` and `outbound-domains` variants together with this script: [`script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js).

## List of variants

Here's a list of all the variants available:

- [Base Variant](#base-variant-script-js)
- [Site Visit Variant](#site-visit-variant-script-site-visit-js)
- [Outbound Domains Variant](#outbound-domains-variant-script-outbound-domains-js)
- [Combined Variant](#combined-variant)

### Base Variant (`script.js`)

The base variant of the script is the most lightweight variant of the script. It supports the following features:

- Detecting the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie.
- Tracking [client-side click events for referral programs](/conversions/clicks/introduction#client-side-click-tracking).
- Setting [custom cookie window](/sdks/client-side/introduction#custom-cookie-window) and [attribution models](/sdks/client-side/introduction#param-data-attribution-model)

Here's how you can use the base variant:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React
<DubAnalytics />
```

```html Other
<script src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"></script>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Site Visit Variant (`script.site-visit.js`)

<Note>`@dub/analytics` site visit feature is still in beta.</Note>

The site visit variant of the script is a variant of the script that supports tracking site visits.

On top of the features supported by the base variant, it also supports tracking the first entry page of a user, which is useful for measuring SEO and Google Ads performance.

Here's how you can use the site visit variant:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React
// the DubAnalytics component automatically detects the `domainsConfig.site` prop
// and applies the site-visit script variant for you
<DubAnalytics domainsConfig={{ site: "site.dub.co" }} />
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.js"
  data-domains='{"site": "site.dub.co"}'
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Outbound Domains Variant (`script.outbound-domains.js`)

The outbound domains variant of the script is a variant of the script that supports [cross-domain tracking](/sdks/client-side/introduction#cross-domain-tracking) across different applications.

On top of the features supported by the base variant, it also supports appending the `dub_id` cookie to all outbound links targeting the domains you configure.

Here's how you can use the outbound domains variant:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React
// the DubAnalytics component automatically detects the `domainsConfig.outbound` prop
// and applies the outbound-domains script variant for you
<DubAnalytics domainsConfig={{ outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"] }} />
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.outbound-domains.js"
  data-domains='{"outbound": ["example.com", "example.sh"]}'
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Combined Variant

You can also mix and match variants. For example, you can use the `site-visit` and `outbound-domains` variants together with this script: [`script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js).

Here's how you can use the combined variant:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React
// the DubAnalytics component automatically detects the `domainsConfig` prop
// and applies the combined script variant for you
<DubAnalytics
  domainsConfig={{
    site: "site.dub.co",
    outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"],
  }}
/>
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js"
  data-domains='{"site": "site.dub.co", "outbound": ["example.com", "example.sh"]}'
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

## `DubAnalytics` React Component

If you're using a React application, we recommend using the `DubAnalytics` component to automatically apply the correct script variant for you.

For example, if you want to use the `outbound-domains` variant, you can do the following:

```typescript React
<DubAnalytics domainsConfig={{ outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"] }} />
```

The `DubAnalytics` component will automatically detect the `domainsConfig` prop and apply the correct script variant for you.
