---

`@dub/analytics` is a client-side script for [tracking conversion events](/conversions/quickstart) with Dub.

By default, the script handles the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie:

Then, when a conversion event occurs (e.g. a user signs up for an account), you can check for the `dub_id` cookie and attribute the conversion to the original click by [tracking a lead event](/conversions/leads/introduction).

Finally, when the user completes a purchase (e.g. subscribing to a plan, purchasing a product, etc.), you can [track a sale event](/conversions/sales/introduction). Under the hood, Dub will automatically attribute the sale to the original link click.
