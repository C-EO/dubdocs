`@dub/analytics` is a lightweight (\<1kb), [open-source](https://github.com/dubinc/analytics) client-side script used for tracking conversions with [Dub Conversions](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions).

The script handles the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

With the script, you can also [track clicks on the client-side](/conversions/clicks/introduction#client-side-click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.

## Installation guides

## Concepts

You can pass the following props to the `@dub/analytics` script to customize its behavior:

<DubAnalyticsParams />

## Examples

Here are some code examples to learn how to use the script:

### Cross-domain tracking

By default, the script already sets the `dub_id` cookie on a cross-domain level. This means that if you have the script installed on your marketing site (e.g. **example.com**), the cookie will also be accessible when your user signs up for your app (e.g. **app.example.com**).

However, if you are installing the script on a subdomain (e.g. **app.example.com**), you will need to set the following option to make sure the cookie is accessible on the apex domain as well (e.g. **example.com**):

<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
<DubAnalytics
  cookieOptions={{
    domain: ".example.com",
  }}
/>
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  data-cookie-options='{"domain": ".example.com"}'
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Custom cookie window

By default, the script sets the `dub_id` cookie to expire in 90 days. You can customize this behavior by passing the `cookieOptions` prop to the script:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
<DubAnalytics
  cookieOptions={{
    expiresInDays: 60, // setting the cookie to expire in 60 days
  }}
/>
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  data-cookie-options='{"expiresInDays": 60}'
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Load the script via a reverse proxy

To avoid ad-blockers from blocking the `@dub/analytics` script, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy.

Depending on which backend framework you're using, there are a few different ways to do this:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Next.js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/_proxy/dub/script.js",
        destination: "https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js",
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

```json Vercel
// vercel.json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/_proxy/dub/script.js",
      "destination": "https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Once you've set up your reverse proxy, don't forget to update the `scriptProps.src` parameter in the `<Analytics />` component to point to your proxy URL.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React/Next.js
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <DubAnalytics
        scriptProps={{
          src: "/_proxy/dub/script.js", // pointing to your reverse proxy
        }}
      />
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
  src="/_proxy/dub/script.js" // pointing to your reverse proxy
  defer
/>
```
