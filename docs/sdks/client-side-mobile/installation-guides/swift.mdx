## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Obtain your [publishable key](/docs/api-reference/authentication#publishable-keys) (`DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) from your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics).
2. You would also want to have your [custom domain](https://app.dub.co/settings/domains) (`DUB_DOMAIN`) handy as well.
3. (Optional) If you plan to track conversions, make sure to [enable conversion tracking for your links](/docs/quickstart/server#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links).
