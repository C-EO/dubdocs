Dub Analytics (`@dub/analytics`) is a lightweight (~1kb), [open-source](https://github.com/dubinc/analytics) client-side script for [tracking conversion events](/help/article/dub-conversions) with Dub.

The script handles the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

If you're using Dub Partners, this script also lets you [track clicks on the client-side](/docs/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.
