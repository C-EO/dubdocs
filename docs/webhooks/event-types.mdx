Webhooks send real-time notifications when events happen in your Dub workspace. All webhook payloads follow this structure:

```json webhook-payload.json
{
  "id": "evt_KleiO4HBwZFbO1vZLWIPZ2AtX",
  "event": "link.created",
  "createdAt": "2024-08-26T16:41:52.346Z",
  "data": {}
}
```

- **id** – Unique event ID
- **event** – Event type (e.g. `link.created`)
- **createdAt** – ISO 8601 timestamp when the event was created
- **data** – Event-specific payload
