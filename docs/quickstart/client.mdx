In this guide, we'll learn how to track conversion events with Dub using client-side tracking.

<Warning>
Client-side conversion tracking comes with the following limitations:
- **Ad blockers** – Users with ad blockers may prevent tracking scripts from loading.
- **JavaScript disabled** – Events won’t be tracked if users have JavaScript disabled.
- **Network issues** – Failed network requests won’t retry automatically.
- **Privacy concerns** – Some users may block client-side tracking for privacy reasons.

For more accurate conversion tracking, consider using [server-side conversion tracking](/docs/quickstart/server).
