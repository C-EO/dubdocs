**Dub Partners** is Dub's affiliate and partner program product. It lets you build powerful, scalable referral and affiliate programs with **1-click global payouts** and **white-labeling functionality**.

<Tip>
  Dub Partners requires a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing) or higher.
</Tip>

In today's day and age, especially with the rise of AI, the best ideas and products are no longer sufficient to rise above the competition. What works is having a powerful distribution network that can produce consistent, repeatable, and profitable results – ideally on autopilot. Think Dropbox's famous "Refer a friend" program, or [Framer's Partner Program](https://www.framer.com/creators/) that generates [$8M worth of payouts](https://x.com/framer/status/1879207447057125549) annually.

**This is where Dub Partners comes in.**

## What does Dub Partners do?

Dub Partners gives you:

1. **Attribution** – Know exactly which partner drove each click, lead, or sale. Real-time insights into what's working for your marketing team and your partners.
2. **Revenue tracking** – Track commissions from conversions, apply your reward rules, and see partner-driven revenue in one place.
3. **Payouts** – Pay partners globally in 1-click with tax compliance and built-in invoicing—no manual spreadsheets.

Everything runs on Dub's link infrastructure, which powers tens of millions of conversion events and hundreds of thousands in partner payouts every month.

## Why Dub Partners?

If you want to grow through partnerships—affiliates, referral partners, or resellers—you need to:

1. **Attribute** – Know which partner drove each sign-up or sale
2. **Reward** – Pay partners fairly based on clicks, leads, or revenue
3. **Scale** – Onboard partners quickly and pay them without manual work

Dub Partners handles all of this. Partners share links; Dub tracks clicks and conversions; you define reward rules; Dub calculates commissions and can pay partners automatically.

## Key concepts

| Concept | What it means |
|--------|----------------|
| **Program** | Your partner program (e.g., "Pingback Affiliate Program"). Each workspace can have one program. |
| **Partner** | A person or company in your program who shares links and earns commissions. |
| **Partner group** | A tier or segment of partners (e.g., "Affiliates", "VIP Partners") with its own reward rules and link structure. |
| **Reward rules** | How partners earn: per click, per lead, per sale, or a mix. You define these per group. |
| **Conversion** | A tracked action (lead or sale) that gets attributed to a partner link. |
| **Commission** | The amount a partner earns from a conversion, based on your reward rules. |

## How it works

1. **You create a program** – Set up your partner program, define reward rules (e.g., % of sale, fixed amount per lead), and configure payouts.
2. **Partners join and get links** – Partners apply or are invited, then receive unique tracking links (short links or query-parameter links).
3. **Visitors click and convert** – When someone clicks a partner link and later signs up or buys, Dub attributes that conversion to the partner.
4. **Commissions are calculated** – Dub applies your reward rules and creates commissions.
5. **Partners get paid** – You can pay via Dub (Stripe Connect) or handle payouts externally.

Dub Partners is built on top of our [enterprise-grade attribution infrastructure](https://dub.co/analytics) that powers 100M+ click and conversion events monthly.

</Frame>

This allows you to maximize your revenue growth by partnering with your most avid users and the best content creators in your niche, without needing to manage them in separate systems.

### Flexible reward structures

With Dub, you can create advanced pay-per-click/lead and rev-share reward structures to drive partner engagement and revenue.

| Reward type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Click-based (pay-per-click)** | Rewarding partners for driving clicks to your product – similar to how Google Ads' pay-per-click works. |
| **Lead-based (pay-per-lead)** | A more effective alternative to pay-per-click, where you reward partners for leads generated (e.g. demo requests, free trial signups, etc.) |
| **Sale-based (pay-per-sale)** | This is the most common reward type, where you reward partners for driving sales to your product either via a rev-share or fixed-price commission. |

### 1-click global payouts + tax compliance

Dub Partners supports [1-click payouts](/managing-a-program/sending-payouts/partner-payouts) to your partners worldwide.

If you're running a partner program with hundreds of partners, instead of manually sending payouts to each partner, you can use Dub to pay your partners in one click, with tax-compliance built in.

### Dual-sided incentives

With Dub Partners, you can create dual-sided incentives for your affiliate/referral programs, which give special discounts to customers who sign up via a referral link.

</Frame>

Some examples include:

- 25% discount for the first 12 months
- 30% lifetime discount
- $50 one-off discount

This can drive powerful word-of-mouth growth as partners are more likely to share their link if it gives their audience additional discounts, and their users are more likely to click on their links if they're getting a special deal.

### AI landing page generator

You can also use our intelligent AI landing page generator to create a compelling, branded landing page for your program to drive partner signups.

### Embedded referral dashboard

One of the unique features of Dub Partners is the ability to create an embedded referral dashboard directly inside your application.

This allows you to seamlessly onboard your users to your referral program, without them needing to leave your app and sign up on a third-party platform.
