**Dub Partners** is Dub's affiliate and partner program product. It's the primary way to run referral and affiliate programs on Dub—with end-to-end **attribution** (know which partner drove each sign-up or sale) and **revenue tracking** (track commissions, pay partners, and scale on autopilot).

<Note>
  Dub Partners requires a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing) or higher.

## What does Dub Partners do?

Dub Partners is the modern affiliate marketing platform for partnering with affiliates, influencers, and your users. It gives you:

1. **Attribution** – Know exactly which partner drove each click, lead, or sale. Real-time insights into what's working for your marketing team and your partners.
2. **Revenue tracking** – Track commissions from conversions, apply your reward rules, and see partner-driven revenue in one place.
3. **Payouts** – Pay partners globally in 1-click with tax compliance and built-in invoicing—no manual spreadsheets.

Everything runs on Dub's link infrastructure, which powers tens of millions of conversion events and hundreds of thousands in partner payouts every month.

## Why Dub Partners?

If you want to grow through partnerships—affiliates, referral partners, or resellers—you need to:

1. **Attribute** – Know which partner drove each sign-up or sale
2. **Reward** – Pay partners fairly based on clicks, leads, or revenue
3. **Scale** – Onboard partners quickly and pay them without manual work

Dub Partners handles all of this. Partners share links; Dub tracks clicks and conversions; you define reward rules; Dub calculates commissions and can pay partners automatically.

## How it works (high level)

1. **You create a program** – Set up your partner program, define reward rules (e.g., % of sale, fixed amount per lead), and configure payouts.
2. **Partners join and get links** – Partners apply or are invited, then receive unique tracking links (short links or query-parameter links).
3. **Visitors click and convert** – When someone clicks a partner link and later signs up or buys, Dub attributes that conversion to the partner.
4. **Commissions are calculated** – Dub applies your reward rules and creates commissions.
5. **Partners get paid** – You can pay via Dub (Stripe Connect) or handle payouts externally.

## Key concepts

| **Program** | Your partner program (e.g., "Pingback Affiliate Program"). Each workspace can have one program. |
| **Partner** | A person or company in your program who shares links and earns commissions. |
| **Partner group** | A tier or segment of partners (e.g., "Affiliates", "VIP Partners") with its own reward rules and link structure. |
| **Reward rules** | How partners earn: per click, per lead, per sale, or a mix. You define these per group. |
| **Conversion** | A tracked action (lead or sale) that gets attributed to a partner link. |
| **Commission** | The amount a partner earns from a conversion, based on your reward rules. |
