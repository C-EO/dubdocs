<Note>
  Dub Partners require a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing) subscription or
  higher.

Dub needs to know when someone who clicked a partner link signs up or buys. That's conversion tracking. This guide covers the two steps to get it working:

1. [Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-1%3A-install-the-%40dub%2Fanalytics-client-side-sdk)
2. [Install the Dub server-side SDK + track conversion events](#step-2%3A-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk-%2B-track-conversion-events)

## Step 1: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

First, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

On top of that, it also:

- lets you [track clicks on the client-side](/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`)
- [automatically fetch the partner and discount data](/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking#automatically-fetching-partner-and-discount-data) for a given link – which is helpful for displaying [dual-sided incentives](/partners/link-based-discounts)

<DubClientInstall />

<DubClientInstallVerify />

Once the script is installed, make sure to verify that [client-side click tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) is working as expected by checking if the following is true:

<VerifyTrackClick />

In case you missed it, you'll also need to allowlist your site's domain to ensure the client-side click events are ingested by Dub. To do that, navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics) and add your site's domain to the **Allowed Hostnames** list.

<Tip>
  When testing things out locally, you can add `localhost` to the **Allowed
  Hostnames** list temporarily. This will allow local events to be ingested by
  Dub. Don't forget to remove it once you're ready to go live!

## Step 2: Install the Dub server-side SDK + track conversion events
