## What is the program landing page?

The program landing page gives your applicants information about your program and the rewards offered. This also includes brand or marketing files, FAQ sections, and any other content you want to add that will help an applicant understand your program, what your product is, and why they should apply.

On Dub, you can create a custom landing page for each [partner group](/managing-a-program/getting-started/partner-groups) in your program. This is helpful for showcasing different information about your program tailored to different partner types – e.g. influencers vs affiliates vs resellers.

By default, when you create a new partner group, it reuses the landing page details from your default partner group, but you can always edit them afterwards.

## Where to find the landing page builder?

From your **Groups** page, open the group you want to customize the landing page for:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/program-group-click.png"
    alt="Opening the group you want to customize the landing page for"
  />
</Frame>

From the tab navigation, click **Branding**, then in the content panel, choose **Landing page** to open the editor.

    alt="Clicking the Branding tab and then the Landing page option"
  />
</Frame>

## Editing and adding content

As you hover over the landing page content in the builder, you'll notice that actions will show, allowing you to add, edit, delete, and reorder content blocks within the page.

    alt="Editing and adding content"
  />
</Frame>

Content above the reward section can only be edited. This is to maintain content consistency. Content below the **"Apply today"** button can be added, edited, removed, and reordered.

## Content types

Clicking on "Insert block" allows you to select the content type you want to add.
