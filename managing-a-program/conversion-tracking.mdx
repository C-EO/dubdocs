Dub needs to know when someone who clicked a partner link signs up or buys. That's conversion tracking. This page explains how it works and what to do next.

## How it works

1. **Visitor clicks a partner link** – Dub stores an ID (cookie) on their device.
2. **Visitor signs up or purchases** – Your app sends that ID to Dub.
3. **Dub attributes the conversion** – The partner gets credit and a commission.

Without this, Dub can't connect a sale to the right partner.

## What your developer needs to do

Two things:

1. **Capture clicks** – Add the `@dub/analytics` script so partner links set the cookie.
2. **Send conversions** – When a user signs up (lead) or buys (sale), call Dub's API with that cookie or customer ID.

## Easiest paths

| Your setup | What to use |
|------------|-------------|
| **Stripe** | [Stripe integration](/conversions/sales/stripe) – tracks sales automatically |
| **Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth, etc.** | [Auth integrations](/conversions/leads/clerk) – track sign-ups |
| **Custom** | [Server-side SDKs](/sdks/overview) – call `track.lead()` and `track.sale()` |
