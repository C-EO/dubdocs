Partners earn commissions when their referrals convert. This page explains how they get paid.

## Two options

| Option | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Dub pays partners** | You connect your bank account. Dub handles payouts via Stripe Connect. Partners connect their PayPal or bank. |
| **You pay partners** | You pay partners yourself (wire, PayPal, etc.). Dub tracks commissions; you handle the money. |

## Dub pays partners (internal)

1. Go to your program's **Payouts** or **Bank account** settings.
2. Connect your bank account so Dub can fund payouts.
3. Set **minimum payout amount** (e.g., $50) and **payout schedule** (e.g., monthly).
4. Partners connect their payout method (PayPal or Stripe Connect) in their dashboard.

Dub debits your account and pays partners automatically.

## You pay partners (external)

1. Go to your program's **Payouts** settings.
2. Choose **External payouts**.
3. Export commission data when it's time to pay.
4. Pay partners via your preferred method (wire, PayPal, check, etc.).

Dub tracks commissions; you handle the actual payment.
