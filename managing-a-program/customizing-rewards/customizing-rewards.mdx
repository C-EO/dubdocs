On [Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners), you can offer different incentives for your partners to incentivize them to create high-quality content to spread the word about your product:

| Reward type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Click-based (pay-per-click)** | Rewarding partners for driving clicks to your product – similar to how Google Ads' pay-per-click works. |
| **Lead-based (pay-per-lead)** | A more effective alternative to pay-per-click, where you reward partners for leads generated (e.g. demo requests, free trial signups, etc.) |
| **Sale-based (pay-per-sale)** | This is the most common reward type, where you reward partners for driving sales to your product either via a rev-share or fixed-price commission. |

During the program onboarding flow, you'll be asked to create a default group reward that will be automatically applied to all new partners who join your program.

This initial reward will be either a lead or a sale-based reward by default, but you can customize the reward terms accordingly.

## Default group rewards

After initial onboarding, you can create additional rewards for clicks, leads, or sales, depending on how you initially set up the group. These rewards will be made available to all partners who join your program.

## Creating a reward

Our reward builder lets you create simple and complex rewards quickly and easily. When the reward builder initially opens, you'll see the basics required to create a reward. Clicking on the different Blue and Orange input prompts allow you to change the structure of the reward.

### Configuring reward types

Depending on the type of reward you're creating, you can choose between a flat fee or a percentage-based commission:

| Reward Type | Model | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Click | Flat | Partners receive a fixed fee for each click generated | $2 per click |
| Lead | Flat | Partners receive a fixed fee for each qualified lead | $50 per lead |
| Sale | Percentage | Partners receive a percentage of sales (revenue share) | 30% of sale value |
| Sale | Flat | Partners receive a fixed fee for each completed sale | $50 per sale |

For sale rewards, you can further customize the recurring nature of the commission:

- For the customer's lifetime
- For a set period (anywhere between 3 months to 3 years)
- One time

### Adding reward conditions

On Dub, you can also set specific requirements for reward completion and can even reward a different type (flat rate or percentage), amount, and duration when they are met. They are available for sale and lead rewards only, and allow you to set conditions like the following:

- Higher rewards for sales over a specific amount
- Higher rewards for partners with more than 100 conversions
- Higher rewards for sales of specific products
- Higher rewards for sales and leads from a specific country

Click Add condition to set these parameters.

Each condition can be based on either Customer, Sale, or Partner, allowing you to mix and match reward conditions to suit your program best.

Conditions let you use AND or OR statements to control how they work. Each condition is tied only to its own reward and doesn't affect others. Your conditions can be as simple or as complex as you need.

Customizing reward conditions is only available on the [Advanced plan and above](https://dub.co/pricing).

### Custom reward descriptions

By default, Dub automatically generates reward descriptions when rewards are created. In some cases, you may want to customize how those rewards are presented to partners, whether that's to better match your brand voice or to make a complex reward easier to understand.

To edit a reward's content, click the pencil icon next to the main reward builder. This opens the content editor, where you can update the primary reward description and optionally add more context using the reward tooltip.

- Click **Reward description** to update the main description. You can enter up to 100 characters to clearly explain the reward at a glance.
- Click **Reward tooltip** to edit the tooltip content. Tooltips support basic markdown and allow up to 2,000 characters, making them ideal for adding detailed explanations or terms.

You can customize each field independently. If you want to remove your custom content, click the X icon next to the custom description. The reward will revert to Dub's default description.

### Reward preview

During the creation of your rewards, the reward preview will populate with the settings you've provided. This preview allows you to see exactly what your partner will see on your program details and within their dashboard.

## Reward examples

Here are a few reward examples with their conditions to give you some starting ideas.

### Geo-specific

When your partners have conversions from specific countries, reward them with a higher percentage.

**Condition:** If Customer Country is one of Canada, United States, Mexico

### Product spotlight

Tailor your reward amount by product. In this example, we're rewarding more when the sale is for the Gold Plan.

**Condition:** If Sale Product ID is Your product ID (show as "Gold Plan" to partners)

If you're using our Stripe integration, the product ID will be the Stripe product ID that the subscription is for (starts with `prod_xxx`).

If you're manually tracking a sale event via our `/track/sale` endpoint, you can pass along the product ID via the [metadata prop](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale) (e.g. `metadata.productId = "prod_xxx"`).

### Partner performance tiers

For creating tiered rewards based on performance. In this example, our base reward is the smallest, and each condition is larger, starting at 50% and growing to 60% based on how many conversions the partner has.

**Condition 1:** If Partner Total conversions is greater than or equal to 100

**Condition 2:** If Partner Total conversions is greater than or equal to 200

### Sale reward tiers

For creating tiered rewards based on customer sales. In this example, we're giving our partners a higher reward if the sale amount is over a specific dollar amount.

**Condition:** If Sale Amount is greater than or equal to $100

### Staggered reward tiers

When you want to offer a different reward amount after the customer's subscription meets a specific time period.

**Base reward:** Pay a Percentage of 10% per sale for the customer's lifetime for all other sales

**Condition:** If Customer Subscription duration is less than or equal to 12 months, then pay a Percentage of 25% per sale for 12 months

In this example, after a customer has been subscribed for more than 12 months, the partner's commission changes from 25% to 10% for all future payouts from that customer.

## Updating a partner group's reward configuration

You can update a [partner group's](/managing-a-program/getting-started/partner-groups) reward configuration at any time. When this happens, historical commissions won't be updated.

However, the reward configuration for a partner-customer pair will be updated. E.g., if a partner used to be on a one-time reward and was switched to recurring rewards, all subsequent subscription renewals from their **previous referrals** will be eligible for commission again.

To avoid this, instead of editing a given partner group's reward configuration directly, create separate partner groups for one-time vs recurring rewards. This way, when you move partners from one group to the other, the reward configuration for the partner's previous referrals will be preserved.
